[{"body": {"body_text": "Two weeks ago, the Fox network was deep in the ratings basement, its performance so dismal it was unclear how it would climb out of the hole it had dug for itself. Then along came the Boston Red Sox. By winning their first World Series in 86 years, the Red Sox did more than just reward their long-suffering fans; they set up what could be the closest ratings race ever among the four major broadcast networks. While Fox's overall ratings this new season are down about 6 percent from last year, the network has moved from fourth place into first among viewers from ages 18 to 49, which all the networks other than CBS define as the only competition that counts. Now, Fox needs to maintain that momentum. And it plans to compete with an onslaught of reality programming never seen before in network television. Beginning this week, Fox is unveiling a schedule that no scriptwriter could love. Although the drama ''The O.C.'' and comedies like ''Arrested Development'' and ''The Simpsons'' are returning, nine of the network's weekly 15 hours of programming -- 60 percent of its total schedule -- will be made up of reality shows. This Wednesday, a ferocious nanny will begin teaching a family how to behave, in ''Nanny 911.'' ''My Big Fat Obnoxious Boss,'' a spoof of NBC's ''The Apprentice'' in which a fake boss makes a group of contestants all but grovel for his approval, makes its debut on Sunday. And beginning on Nov. 9, the British entrepreneur Richard Branson will try to teach a group of young people how to risk life and limb to become wealthy in ''The Rebel Billionaire.'' Fox is banking on reality to hold the ratings fort until January. That is when some new scripted series and returning shows like ''24'' -- along with the network's reality life preserver, ''American Idol'' -- go on the air. The strategy is a risky one. Reality shows tend to be less attractive to advertisers, and by introducing so many reality series, the network might kill off a genre that has all but saved network television over the last five years. ''It's flying in the face of what is happening elsewhere,'' said Steve Sternberg, senior vice president of the media buying company Magna Global USA, referring to the failure of several new reality shows (like ''The Next Great Champ'') and the success of new dramas (like ''Desperate Housewives''). But Fox, which announced its intention last spring to reconstruct the whole nature of the television season, is simply playing its own game. ''I don't even know what's normal anymore,'' said Preston Beckman, executive vice president of program planning for Fox. Fox has been among the most aggressive networks in moving away from the classic September-May television season, staggering the premieres of shows so it can run original programming throughout the year. That approach allows broadcast networks to avoid repeats, which have a tendency to send viewers to the original programming playing on cable channels. In addition, the baseball playoffs put Fox at a disadvantage for starting new shows in September, because it would have had to pre-empt episodes through much of October. Mr. Beckman said Fox decided this year that it needed ''to take a different approach coming out of baseball.'' That meant not trying to start up a batch of new series, some clearly aimed at women, as it did last year with dramas like the ill-fated ''Skin.'' Instead, Fox larded its baseball coverage with promotions for man-friendly reality fare like the Branson series (a combination of ''The Apprentice,'' ''Amazing Race'' and ''Fear Factor'') and especially ''Obnoxious Boss'' in an attempt to create a kind of ''obnoxious'' franchise. Last year, Fox scored with an obnoxious fianc\u00e9; this year an actor playing an ersatz business mogul systematically humiliates some hapless contestants, all in good fun. Fox, viewing the show as a comedy, has placed it on Sunday at 9 p.m., after four situation comedies. That night is one of the few where Fox has any concentration of scripted series. The only other night where two hours of scripted shows run back to back is Thursday, where Fox has placed its most promising series, ''The O.C.,'' putting it up against CBS's ''Survivor'' and NBC's ''Joey'' in the hopes it can finally reap some of the lucrative ad money spent on Thursday night by movie companies and car dealers. ''I'm feeling optimistic that we may finally get a toehold on the most important night of the week,'' Mr. Beckman said. Monday, meanwhile, has two reality hours, ''Trading Spouses,'' the wife-swapping experiment, and ''The Swan,'' the beauty contest for post-cosmetic-surgery ugly ducklings. Wednesday has ''Nanny 911.'' Friday has two half-hour video-clip shows, followed by ''Renovate My Family,'' a makeover show for entire family units. And Saturdays have the hoary Fox reality duo, ''Cops'' and ''America's Most Wanted.'' Part of the rationale for this heavy dose of reality is boldness: Mr. Beckman noted that Fox was trying to deconstruct the traditional television season. Another part, he acknowledged, is pure necessity. Fox saw one returning scripted show, ''Bernie Mac,'' put on hiatus. But some critics and industry executives suggest another explanation: Fox is all but bereft of strong scripted series. ''They don't have the scripted guns anymore,'' said Stacey Lynn Koerner, executive vice president of Initiative Media. ''They had 'Ally McBeal,' they had 'X-Files.' Those shows don't exist anymore.'' Fox has a few newer scripted shows like the comedy ''Quintuplets'' and the soap ''North Shore.'' But Mr. Sternberg said that neither of these elicited much more than a tepid response in tryouts earlier. In addition, several long-running Fox shows, like ''Malcolm in the Middle,'' ''King of the Hill'' and ''That 70's Show,'' are showing signs of wear. ''In some other publication, I accused Fox of creative bankruptcy,'' said Jon Mandel, the chairman of MediaCom US, the media service division of Grey Global. Although he said that Mr. Beckman had disputed that characterization, he said two of Fox's new reality series, ''Trading Spouses'' and ''Nanny 911,'' are copies of ABC shows. Mr. Mandel added, ''I think I stand by my line about creative bankruptcy.'' The other potential downside to a reality-centric schedule is that it almost surely cannot make as much money as a schedule skewed toward scripted series, said Mr. Mandel, whose MediaCom clients include such big television advertisers as Procter & Gamble, Mars Inc. and BellSouth. In general, advertisers are still more reluctant to back reality shows, Mr. Mandel said, or at least certain reality shows. '''American Idol' is O.K. for any advertiser,'' he said. ''It's when you get to the schlocky stuff, like 'The Swan' and 'Obnoxious Boss,' that it becomes a problem for some advertisers.'' The style of Fox reality, he said, tends ''to have a negativity that unfortunately a lot of people don't find very entertaining.'' Although the idea of a cohesive schedule may be a relic, Mr. Mandel added: ''I think there will be such a thing as a cohesive brand. With CBS, for example, you pretty much know what you're going to get. With Fox, you don't really know. I wonder if those negative, put-down reality shows don't affect the traditional scripted shows. ''When you do a great show like 'Arrested Development,' it can't get arrested,'' he said. ''Maybe it's because nobody expected it on Fox.'' Ms. Koerner, however, praised the network. ''I applaud them for sticking by what they said they were going to do,'' she said. ''They have rolled out their schedule just as they said they would.'' And Mr. Sternberg, pointing to previous midseason successes like ''The Simpsons'' and ''Malcolm in the Middle,'' said that Fox should never be counted out. ''They have a long history of being able to come up with new hits when they really need them,'' Mr. Sternberg said.", "title": "Fox Will Follow Red Sox Surge With Reality TV"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/Business", "Top/News/Business/Media and Advertising", "Top/News", "Top/News/Sports/Baseball/Major League/Boston Red Sox", "Top/News/Sports/Baseball", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Media, Entertainment and Publishing"], "publication_day_of_month": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Business", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Business/Financial Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Monday", "print_section": "C", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/01/business/media/01fox.html", "print_column": "5", "slug": "01FOX$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Washington has been hostile territory for some media companies recently, and the industry has responded by spreading more money around. The broadcast communications industry increased its spending on lobbyists more than 16 percent over the last five years, according to a study released Thursday by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan media watchdog organization. Clear Channel Communications, the broadcasting giant that has been the target of obscenity fines by a more vigilant Federal Communications Commission, was a particularly active spender last year. The company paid $2.28 million to lobbyists last year, up from $68,675 in 2002. Over all, the industry, defined in the study as broadcasters, cable networks and telecommunications companies, spent $169.2 million in 2003 on lobbying, up from $145.3 million in 1998. By contrast, the oil and gas industry lobby grew only slightly over the same period, spending $59.4 million in 2003, up from $58.8 million in 1998, according to a separate study conducted by the center. ''The media is, by and large, an industry, and it has legislative goals,'' said John Dunbar, the lead author of the study. Two items high on the industry's agenda are deregulation and a relaxation of restrictions on media ownership. The industry also made campaign contributions totaling $1.81 million to President Bush, widely acknowledged as a proponent of deregulation, and $1.1 million to Senator John Kerry. However, contributions to the Democratic Party outpaced those to the Republican Party by nearly $20 million over the last six years, according to the study. The Washington Post Company, which continued to expand its digital cable operations, quadrupled its lobbying budget to $360,000 in 2003, up from $80,000 in 2002. Belo, which lobbied the F.C.C. to lift its ban on owning a newspaper and a television station in the same city, spent $420,000 last year, up from $200,000 a year earlier. Another big spender in Washington is the News Corporation, the parent company of Fox News, which spent $3.9 million on lobbying expenditures in 2003. Employees of News Corporation have given $3.3 million in political contributions since 1998. Despite accusations that the company has a right-wing slant, 81 percent of those donations went to the Democratic Party. Some critics have charged that some of the goals of lobbying are not in the best interests of consumers. ''The press has indoctrinated itself in the United States in the form of a corporate model,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center and former dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. She also predicted that the communications industry was likely to continue spending heavily in Washington. ''They want to keep the gains they've got, and they want to consolidate further,'' she said. Mr. Dunbar agreed and said there was no foreseeable end to the med-ia's use of lobbyists. ''The only time that will stop is when there aren't any more government regulations,'' he said. ''Then, you've won.'' Correction:  November 2, 2004, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about a 16 percent rise in spending on lobbying by the media industry over the last five years referred to the figure imprecisely.

But what if they want to see the prices at the local mall that day? A trio of new online companies -- Cairo.com, ShopLocal.com and StepUp.com -- are trying to fill that need. For example, Cairo.com, which introduced its Web site late last month, scans the Web sites of about 25 national merchants to cull sales data from the retailers' weekly circulars. Consumers enter their ZIP code and can search the database for particular items, or register to receive an e-mail message when the price of an item drops. ''A lot of people just need a good camera and need it today and want a good deal,'' said Andy Moss, Cairo.com's chief executive. ''This is for them.'' The goal of the offline comparison sites is to overcome the enormous limitation of most existing shopping-comparison services: that online shopping accounts for only about 7 percent of all purchases made by consumers. The idea of offering searches of offline stores -- from the big chains to local merchants -- has been tried before without much success or cooperation from stores. These new sites are hoping the timing is better this time as the interest in serving Internet users with more localized search results seems to be climbing. Both Google and Yahoo, for example, are starting to offer more localized services. The companies are also entering the market as consumers are relying more heavily on the Internet to guide them in offline purchases. Dieringer Research Group, a consulting firm in Milwaukee, surveyed 2,000 people this summer and found that for every dollar consumers spent online, they spent $1.70 offline after doing online research. Last year, the figure was $1.50. ''These sites are a good fit with where shoppers are right now,'' said Thomas E. Miller, an analyst with Dieringer. Indeed, Mr. Miller said the sites satisfy a long-standing desire among shoppers. Ten years ago, he designed a survey asking Internet users what they would like to see from the new medium. ''Apart from entertainment, the No. 1 thing people wanted to do was have an interactive Yellow Pages,'' he said. While these sites do not provide an exhaustive list of retailers like Yellow Pages Web sites, they can be more efficient in guiding consumers to the right product. Last week, for instance, a Cairo.com search for a digital camera in Midtown Manhattan returned a list of 58 products, including the Fuji FinePix A330 on sale for $150 at both Radio Shack and Best Buy. ShopLocal turned up a Concord camera at Office Max for $100 and StepUp's lowest price was $99 for a Sony Cyber-shot at Best Buy. But Carrie Johnson, an analyst with the online consultancy Forrester Research, said these new sites do not cover enough merchants to be useful to consumers. One problem is that these sites need Internet access to the retailers' systems, so that they can transmit information quickly to their users, and few retailers now allow that. ''The selection on these sites is limited to what they've scoured from circulars'' and from inventory lists of the few retailers that offer online access to the lists, Ms. Johnson said. ''So at the category level, you're comparing just a couple of stores, which isn't that valuable, frankly.'' Part of the problem, Ms. Johnson said, is that few retailers have systems in place to provide information on inventories at the store level, so these services cannot track prices of anything other than sale items. ''Every couple of years a company tries to make this work, and fails, and one of the main reasons is that there's not enough retailers involved to get customers interested,'' she said. The selection of merchants could grow quickly, though, thanks partly to an unlikely source -- newspapers. Earlier this year, Gannett, Knight Ridder and Tribune bought CrossMedia Services, a Chicago company that helps retailers put their sales circulars online. CrossMedia also has, since 1999, operated SalesHound.com, one of the earliest sites to allow consumers to compare sale items at offline stores. Under the new ownership, CrossMedia in August created ShopLocal, a site with features similar to SalesHound. Each of the chain's newspaper Web sites has begun featuring ShopLocal as a service for local readers to find bargains. With the additional exposure on sites like ChicagoTribune.com and LATimes.com, more merchants are interested in getting involved, said Dave Hamel, CrossMedia's chief marketing officer. Mr. Hamel said more than 70 national merchants already forward information on upcoming sales to the company, and ShopLocal attracts about 18,000 visitors daily. Soon, he said, advertising salespeople from local newspapers will begin forwarding similar sales information from their clients, giving more customers reason to visit. ''Chicago is ready to feed us 600 retailers a week,'' Mr. Hamel said. Retailers typically pay between 5 cents and 40 cents every time a consumer clicks to view details of an item for sale in their store. Other local shopping sites collect revenue in a similar manner. One of the reasons online search sites like Google and shopping-comparison sites like Shopping.com have won fans among investors recently is that marketers have quickly warmed to the idea of paying only when someone clicks on their advertisement. Offline retailers have been slower to embrace that model because, unlike e-tailers, they never know if the person who clicks on the ad ultimately buys a product. Mr. Hamel, of CrossMedia, said he was doing research using offline shoppers to persuade retailers that their online advertising dollars increase store sales. Retailers like the Bombay Company, of Fort Worth, will also create printable coupons for ShopLocal, with codes allowing stores to track the sale to the online promotion. According to Matt Corey, the Bombay Company's vice president of marketing and e-commerce, ShopLocal has proved useful in creating awareness of his company's new brand, Bombay Kids. Even if shoppers do not click on the company's brand among the search results, the name recognition helps. ''Any time you're building a new brand, you need every type of awareness campaign you can get,'' he said. Mr. Corey added that Bombay's brand image would not be cheapened by allowing its products to be compared primarily on price. ''Some retailers ask 'Why in the world would you want your products next to some other company's?''' Mr. Corey said. ''That's not a marketing problem. That's a merchandise confidence problem. Customers will find your product and they will compare them.''

It also appears the team's first title in 86 years may help reverse a recent trend on Madison Avenue. For several years, agencies and advertisers seeking the most effective way to spend scarce marketing dollars have preferred to sign endorsement deals with athletes known for long-term performance, rather than the winners of a big game or a championship whose prowess -- and fame -- may be fleeting. That is why Cal Ripken Jr., Joe Montana and Wayne Gretzky appear in advertising almost as often as active athletes. ''Advertisers have recently been using not only retired players but managers like Joe Torre and owners like George Steinbrenner,'' said Bob Dorfman, executive vice president and executive creative director of Pickett Advertising in San Francisco, who specializes in matching athletes with marketers. ''They're even using fake players they make up, like Leon,'' he added, referring to a vain, money-mad character who appears in commercials for Budweiser created by the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. For marketers, the uplifting tale reverberating in the news media of how the Red Sox returned to the victors' circle after more than eight decades of futility is elevating the team to a status far above that of typical winners of a single title. For instance, the celebratory ''What's Next?'' campaign from the Walt Disney Company, in which athletes proclaim, ''I'm going to Disney World!'' (or Disneyland), has recently been playing down one-trick ponies in favor of sustained success stories. But immediately after the Red Sox beat the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 4 last Wednesday, Disney and its agency in Chicago, Tapestry, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group division of the Publicis Groupe, filmed three Boston teammates -- Pedro Mart\u00ednez, David Ortiz and Curt Schilling -- for commercials in which they declare, in English and Spanish, ''We're going to Disney World!'' The commercials began running the next evening on television networks like ABC, Fox, Telemundo and Univision. And Disney brought the players to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., for parades on Thursday and Friday. ''We saw an incredible achievement, the reverse of the curse, taking place, so this is one that deserves to be recognized,'' said Michael Mendenhall, executive vice president for global marketing at the parks and resorts division of Disney in Burbank, Calif. ''You could feel the momentum building with consumers,'' he added, ''and when the Red Sox broke the so-called curse, we celebrated with them.'' Another totem of athletic achievement, an appearance on the Wheaties cereal box, had not been conferred on a World Series winner by General Mills since the New York Yankees beat the Atlanta Braves in 1999. But Mr. Ortiz, with his teammates in the background, will show up on several million Wheaties packages now being distributed nationally. ''The history of the Red Sox is a great story, one of the biggest in sports,'' said Greg Zimprich, a spokesman for the Big G cereals division of General Mills in Golden Valley, Minn. ''We felt Wheaties should be there and be part of it.'' The Red Sox are also a team ''that has a great following nationally,'' he added, which could stimulate Wheaties sales more than if the team had only local or regional appeal. Mr. Zimprich recalled during a recent visit to Los Angeles ''driving down Santa Monica Boulevard and seeing a bar with a big Red Sox logo out front.'' The Gillette Company, which is based in Boston and has been sponsoring baseball and World Series games since 1904, ran an advertisement in Boston newspapers on Friday congratulating the Red Sox. ''We'd like to say we would have run the ad no matter who won the World Series, but that's not the case,'' said Michele Szynal, a spokeswoman for Gillette. ''I can't remember the company ever doing this before,'' she added. ''It has been 86 years, so this is special.'' The ad, by BBDO Worldwide in New York, part of Omnicom, shows a baseball under a four-line headline: ''Faith over doubt. Guts over ghosts. Destiny over dynasty. Sox over Cards.'' Another baseball mainstay, the Topps Company, is rushing out a boxed collection of 55 trading cards, priced at $19.99 and bearing the lengthy label of the ''2004 World Champion Boston Red Sox World Series Commemorative Gift Set.'' It is the first time that Topps, which has sold baseball cards since 1951, has so honored a World Series victor. ''The Red Sox are iconic and their fans are not limited to Boston,'' said Clay Luraschi, a spokesman for Topps in New York. ''We don't have an estimated run for the set right now, but we think it will be pretty big.'' Topps had considered a similar set last year, Mr. Luraschi said, but placed it on hold when the Red Sox lost Game 7 of the American League Championship Series to the Yankees. ''This time, we didn't start printing it till that last out,'' he added, laughing. ''It was a little tough for some Topps employees to swallow, because we're New York-based, but even if you weren't a Red Sox fan, you wanted them to do it.'' Topps is selling the cards on its Web site (www.topps.com) and starting next Monday will have them on sale at hobby shops and retail chains like Target and Wal-Mart. Another sports marketer, Nike, planned to run a commercial saluting the Red Sox last year, only to shelve it after the loss to the Yankees. The spot, by Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., appeared after Boston beat the Yankees for the American League pennant on Oct. 20, and then again last Wednesday after the Red Sox won the World Series. Mr. Dorfman of Pickett Advertising said he believed there are ''a few Red Sox who might break through'' to become busy pitchmen, although ''it might have helped if the Series had gone more than four games'' so the players had gained more national exposure. Among the players Mr. Dorfman listed were Mr. Ortiz and Mr. Ramirez, because their ethnic backgrounds represent ''a huge opportunity for the Latino market.'' Indeed, the Disney commercials they filmed with Mr. Schilling were the first in the ''What's Next?'' campaign to run in Spanish as well as English, said Mr. Mendenhall of Disney. Mr. Dorfman also listed Mr. Schilling as a possible star spokesman, but added that his endorsement of President Bush on Thursday ''could hurt him.'' (Mr. Schilling said a day later that it was wrong for him to ''offer up my political opinions unsolicited.'') The hirsute outfielder Johnny Damon is most likely to succeed as an endorser, Mr. Dorfman said, because ''he's instantly recognizable'' for his appearance as well as his good-natured use of the word ''idiots'' to describe his teammates. ''He's really blue-collar,'' Mr. Dorfman said, ''a classic for commercials for beer, pizza, candy bars, video games.'' Mr. Damon has already worked for Gillette, Ms. Szynal said, shaving his beard with the company's new M3 Power razor in May and donating $15,000 to a literacy program, Read Boston. As World Series viewers saw, the beard has since grown back. Could Schick be calling Boston directory assistance for Mr. Damon's number?

Sam ''Mayday'' Malone, a fictional former Boston pitcher ruined by drink, tended the bar he owned, chased his waitress, and probably placed some bets on his old team. Now Ted Danson, the actor who portrayed Sam Malone, is making Red Sox fans proud for a different reason: as a result of Boston's World Series victory last week, Mr. Danson won the first bet ever decided at Long Bets (longbets.org), an online prediction site that focuses on scores that may not be settled for 45 years, if ever. The Web site, which is popular among the Silicon Valley digerati, is a spinoff from the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco, whose aim is to foster long-term thinking and stimulate discussion about the future. Members make predictions, typically about topics like immigration or artificial intelligence, and other members challenge them, accompanied by a minimum wager of $200. Unlike most betting parlors, however, these contest are rarely about sports. Alexander Rose, executive director of the Long Bets Foundation, said all the predictions had ''some social or scientific value.'' The Red Sox bet slipped in because Michael Elliot, the editor of Time Asia, argued that the United States soccer team would win the World Cup before the Red Sox won the World Series. In an argument posted on the site, he said his larger point was that immigration and technology would improve the quality of American soccer, but that the curse of the Bambino was ''one of those mystical truths that are beyond the reach of human intervention.'' Mr. Danson's counter was also scientific. ''Statistically, scoring goals is harder than hitting a home run and in the World Cup you have the whole WORLD against you,'' he wrote. In baseball, he argued, ''the Red Sox only really have to beat the Yankees.'' Mr. Danson, who was not available to comment, now gets to donate $2,000 (they each bet $1,000, but winners receive bragging rights but no cash, according to the site's rules), plus interest accumulated since the wager was made in February 2002, to a charity of his choice. Mr. Elliot, a self-described Yankee fan, said in an e-mail response, ''I feel sorta proud to be the first to have lost, actually!''

Then there is Legal Affairs, a two-year-old magazine of law and ideas that was born and nurtured at Yale Law School. Even though the magazine has no claim to financial success, Legal Affair's staff has decided to shed its Yale ties and go it alone. The January/February issue will be the first to appear without the label, ''A magazine of Yale Law School.'' Yale's money probably will not end, but it is expected to flow more slowly and perhaps less predictably. ''The idea was there would be a period of a couple years when the magazine would operate under the protective umbrella of the institution,'' said Seth P. Waxman, a former solicitor general of the United States and a faculty member at the Georgetown University Law Center, who was recently elected chairman of the magazine's board. ''The notion always was that the intellectual space and the social space this magazine was intended to fill was not the private province of Yale Law School,'' he added. Lincoln Caplan, editor and president at Legal Affairs, says he sees several advantages in stripping Yale from the masthead. One is the possibility of attracting a second look from potential readers who feel no affinity with Yale. Another is that advertisers, sponsors and foundations may be more willing to consider supporting a magazine that is no longer cashing checks from Yale, he said. ''Without the support of Yale and other funders, the magazine wouldn't exist,'' Mr. Caplan said, adding that the magazine is on track to become self-sustaining by 2007. Circulation has grown to around 21,000 and traffic to the Web site is growing, Mr. Caplan said, citing the Legal Affairs blog, called How Appealing. And even though no one would describe the magazine as part of the mass media, it has gained recognition for quality: The Chicago Tribune named Legal Affairs one of the 50 best magazines in the country, putting it on an eclectic list that also included The Economist, Wired and WoodenBoat. Mr. Waxman, the magazine's board chairman, said: ''This is not a shopping magazine. We're hoping that people will come to the magazine to shop for ideas and stimulation.''

But what she really wanted was to be in front of the camera. So, after leaving Fox in September, Ms. Huda, 26, decided to get some media training at Qorvis Communications, the politically connected public affairs firm in Washington. A media environment of round-the-clock news shows and a seemingly insatiable demand for talking heads is creating new opportunities for media trainers. Traditionally, media training was offered by large public relations firms like Burson-Marsteller and Hill & Knowlton. Those companies now face lots of competition -- from independent shops and former reporters in business for themselves to midsize firms like Qorvis. Paul Holmes, editor of The Holmes Report in New York, an electronic newsletter for the public relations industry, said he had no statistics, but that it seemed to him that there had been increase in former television anchors, reporters and producers who had become independent media trainers. And virtually all the big firms offer media training, usually by experienced former reporters and TV newspeople, he said. ''You lose your job as a journalist or get hungry for better pay, and you start a media training practice or get hired by a P.R. firm,'' he said. ''Some of them have very good in-house media training facilities with lots of former reporters on staff, mock TV studios, the whole nine yards. But I'd say there's only a half-dozen firms that do a really good job.'' The Web is becoming a popular advertising tool for former reporters now in the training business. Many promote themselves with lines like ''ex-reporter covered stories you remember,'' or ''former journalist has trained hundreds of spokespeople and execs.'' Sallie L. Gaines, a vice president at Hill & Knowlton in Chicago, says media training has always been a big business for the agency, especially executives who want to learn better crisis communications. After recent financial scandals and other events rocked the business world, it does seem that more companies at least anticipate communicating with the media in a crisis, she said. But much of their business still comes from people who were caught unprepared. ''We are getting more companies wanting to be prepared for a crisis, but usually what happens is a crisis hits, and a company calls us because we're known,'' she said. ''Typically, we get called afterwards and the longer after, the worse it is. The first 24 hours is most important.'' Qorvis, which handles public relations in the United States for Saudi Arabia, recently opened its own mock television studio in Washington to capitalize on what it perceives as a growing demand for media training. A firm with about $17 million in yearly revenue, Qorvis is targeting niche clients such as executives facing investigative hearings or academics and print reporters who are increasingly called to comment on talk shows. So what do they learn? A lot of the time, just the experience of being exposed to the lights, camera and action is important, Ms. Donaghy said. Other times, trainers stress the need to speak in sound bites with a clear message, or not to dart the eyes and shift around. And they also discuss how to get the best interview possible. ''I've been on the other end of it where you need quotable guests,'' said Nina Donaghy, who joined Qorvis this year from the BBC in London. ''I know why you keep booking the same people again and again -- people who are reliable, in terms of sound bites and looking presentable.'' For Ms. Huda, who was trained by Rich Masters, a managing director at Qorvis, her instruction involved a few hours of taping as she read stories and conducted mock interviews. She is hoping the confidence that the training gave her will help her land a job as an on-air television news reporter. ''It only takes seconds for someone to form an opinion about you on the air,'' Ms. Huda said. ''The training showed me some tricks and techniques to come across as polished and informed.'' For some critics, more media training is not good news. Sheldon Rampton, research director for the Center for Media and Democracy based in Madison, Wis., said the problem with media training -- especially in crisis management -- is that it's more about presentation than facts. He said crisis management teaches executives to stay on message and to be nice. ''There's a lot less candor,'' Mr. Rampton said. ''People are so disciplined about staying on message, you're getting canned talking points rather than something genuinely informative.''

Mr. Chen, a Taiwanese-born American citizen who was considered one of the nation's most brilliant supercomputer designers while working in this country for the technology pioneer Seymour Cray in the 1980's, has moved to China -- where he is leading an effort to claim the world computing speed record. Supercomputing is being seized upon by the Chinese government to help speed the nation's transition from low-cost manufacturing to becoming a more powerful force in the world economy. China's leaders know that high-speed computing is essential to global leadership in scientific fields and advanced design of a variety of sophisticated products. ''Right now the Chinese have started to pay attention; they are catching up and they learn fast,'' said Mr. Chen, 60, who is splitting his time between China and San Jose, Calif., where his wife, Kate, and their four children live. Military intelligence experts in this country have long been concerned that supercomputing capabilities may aid China's weapons development. But many technologists and economists say that blazing computing speeds alone do not represent a particularly new nuclear weapons threat. Instead, they are more concerned that the Chinese may catch up more quickly with the United States in areas that have economic and scientific, rather than military, ramifications. Mr. Chen's decision to set up shop in China was driven in part by an unexpected twist: the opportunity to build a new company looked more promising to him there than in the United States, where he was unable to secure financing from American venture capitalists for his latest ideas. Mr. Chen concluded that the fallout from the collapse of the Internet bubble had poisoned the investment climate. ''I saw the crazy stuff going on,'' he said recently in a telephone interview from Shenzhen, near Hong Kong. ''A lot of people got hurt.'' While Mr. Chen is not a native of mainland China, his decision has parallels to an increasingly common odyssey by foreign-born researchers, who once would have found the greatest openings to use their skills in the United States. As the spread of capitalism creates opportunities elsewhere, many such talented people are returning to China, India and other developing countries to create or join advanced technology firms. In May, Mr. Chen joined Galactic Computing Shenzhen, which is backed by investment money from a Hong Kong company that supported an earlier Chen venture and with further backing from a group of Chinese universities. His move reflects the fact that the market for high-performance computing is growing more rapidly in China than elsewhere in the world. The Chinese are not yet a major force in supercomputing, but according to American computing experts, that is changing rapidly. Today there are 14 Chinese supercomputers among the top 500, ranking the country fourth in the world, equal to Germany and behind only the United States, Japan and Britain. In June, a supercomputer assembled at the Shanghai Supercomputer Center using more than 2,500 chips designed and manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices of Sunnyvale, Calif., became the world's 10th-fastest computer. ''In terms of momentum they are the most rapidly ascending country in the world,'' said David Keyes, a professor of applied mathematics at Columbia University, who visited China last month to participate in a conference on high-performance computing. Galactic recently demonstrated a prototype of Mr. Chen's newest supercomputer at a biomedical research institute in Beijing. The machine, he said, is capable of one trillion calculations a second, a performance level that would place it among the top half of the world's 500 fastest computers. Such computing now occupies a central role throughout the global economy, providing stark proof that decades-long American attempts to control the flow of advanced information-processing technologies are largely moot. It is only a matter of time, experts say, before companies in places like China, India and Russia essentially match the capabilities of the American and Japanese leaders. ''When they really get noticed,'' said Horst D. Simon, director of the computation center at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, ''will be when a country like Malaysia or Australia decides to buy a supercomputer from a Chinese company like Mr. Chen's rather than from I.B.M.'' Now that computer chips openly available anywhere in the world have reached such high speeds, the expertise needed to build supercomputers has shifted to the software needed to hook hundreds or thousands of processors together. Mr. Chen has long been recognized as one of the world's pioneers in that specialty. He arrived in the United States from Taiwan in 1975, at age 31, to pursue graduate studies in computer science. During the 1980's, Mr. Chen was widely considered one the leading computer designers in the United States. As a computer architect at Cray Research from 1979 to 1987, he gained a reputation for machines that were both elegant and blindingly fast. He also became known as a visionary who frequently needed assistance in finishing overambitious projects. ''He's very charismatic,'' said David J. Kuck, a computer scientist and Intel researcher, who was Mr. Chen's professor in a Ph.D. program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the 1970's. ''His English wasn't the greatest, but everyone understood what he wanted to do.'' As a graduate student, Mr. Chen designed one of the first software programs known as a parallel compiler, which was useful in restructuring programs so they could run on computers with multiple processors. That pioneering work became the basis for much of today's commercial parallel computing software. At Cray Research, Mr. Chen had an intense rivalry with Mr. Cray, who was leading a team that pursued a competing design. Ultimately, Cray's chief executive, John Rollwagen, canceled one of Mr. Chen's computer projects. Soon afterward, in September 1987, Mr. Chen established his own supercomputing company, Supercomputing Systems, with backing from International Business Machines. That effort led to a partially completed prototype, but the company failed commercially in 1992 when I.B.M. canceled funding. Because the Cold War was ending, military funding for high-performance computing slowed dramatically. Later, Mr. Chen became the chief technology officer of Sequent Computer Systems, which was later acquired by I.B.M. Mr. Chen's decision to try his luck in China as an entrepreneur stands in contrast to an earlier example of technology transfer from the United States to China. During the 1950's Tsien Hsue-shen, a leading aerospace designer with a Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology, was deported from the United States as a presumed security threat during the Communist witch hunts of the McCarthy era. After returning to China, he became the father of the country's intercontinental missile program. During the Clinton administration, Washington attempted to control the flow of high-performance computers to China because of fears they could be used to design nuclear weapons. That policy, with modifications, has continued. Indeed, just this month, State Department officials renewed calls for maintaining the arms sales embargo against China, which extends to restrictions on the fastest computers. But with the new type of supercomputer -- which blends thousands of freely available off-the-shelf microprocessors connected via high-speed fiber-optic cables that can stretch for hundreds of miles -- restrictions on the sale of so-called dual-use computers that have both military and civilian applications no longer stand in the way of developing systems able to compete with the fastest machines made by American and Japanese companies. American supercomputer experts said that Mr. Chen's move to China could have a major impact, similar to the shock felt among government technology insiders in 2002 when Japan developed the Earth Simulator, currently the world's fastest supercomputer. ''There is no stronger form of technology transfer than to have a world-class expert go off with all his knowledge,'' said Seymour Goodman, a physicist at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. Mr. Chen was an eager convert to American ways after he moved to the United States from Taiwan, even bringing members of his extended family to Eau Claire, Wis., where he established a stylish Chinese restaurant. Mr. Chen said he still viewed himself primarily as a scientist dedicated to contributing to supercomputer design in ways that would benefit not just China but the United States and the rest of the world, too. He said he intended to pursue that goal with whoever offered him the greatest help. That reflects long-held views, which he expressed in an interview with The New York Times in the early 1990's. ''I come from a very humble family and Confucian teachings are in my background,'' he said then. ''When I came to the United States and I observed this disciplined, businesslike, practical manner, I found a marriage of the two cultures. I also saw the bad points of each.''

Evidence is accumulating that nanotechnology may enable better early warning systems for cancer and heart disease, cures for progressive diseases like cystic fibrosis, techniques for making implants like artificial hips more successful, and even artificial kidneys. But there is no reliable timeline for the home-run projects, according to specialists like Dr. Peter R. Cavanagh, chairman of the department of biomedical engineering at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, one of the nation's largest hospital and health research centers. ''We know how to make rubber, and we know where the road is going to go,'' Dr. Cavanagh told an international gathering of nanotechnology researchers and physicians at the Cleveland Clinic last week. ''What we don't know is where the rubber is going to meet the road.'' Nanotechnology has garnered headlines and billions of dollars of federal investment because of its potentially broad effects on all parts of commerce. It is already used in consumer products like transparent sunscreens and stain-resistant clothing. But its capacity for mixing and matching molecules seems especially suited for transforming medicine. Nanotechnology involves industrial products and processes in the realm of nanometers, or billionths of a meter. That is also the scale on which all living cells -- and the things that nourish or kill them -- operate. Viruses, for instance, range in size from 20 nanometers to 300 nanometers, with human antibodies roughly the size of smaller viruses. For that reason, medical research has long worked on the nanoscale. For example, Dr. H.David Humes at the University of Michigan and Dr. Tejal Desai at Boston University are using machinery and processes adapted from the semiconductor industry to build prototypes of implantable artificial organs with pores or slits smaller than 20 nanometers wide. Such nanofilters are the only way to let essential nutrients pass in and out of the devices while excluding cells and other biological matter that can clog or poison them. Medical device companies have also routinely tinkered with the molecular structures of the surfaces of the materials they use. For devices like pacemakers, one goal is to make them less hospitable to in-growth from tissues that could impair the devices. In other cases, as with hip or knee implants, the engineers try to make the body's tissues bind to the surface as fast as possible. In recent years, scanning electron microscopes and atomic force microscopes have allowed bioengineers to get sharper images of what they were doing. And computer-controlled machinery has given them the ability to manipulate the size, shape and surfaces of drugs and devices. Now, for example, device makers not only shape the surfaces of their products, but they may also add specialty coatings like those from Biophan Technologies. Biophan's coatings, made up of magnetic particles 20 nanometers to 40 nanometers across, make the devices visible to magnetic resonance imaging machines used to track their placement. The new tools inevitably conjure up ''Fantastic Voyage,'' the 1960's science-fiction thriller in which a medical team was shrunk and launched into a patient's bloodstream in a cell-size submarine to wipe out a blood clot in the victim's brain. Indeed, Dr. Aaron J. Fleischman, co-director of the laboratory that Cleveland Clinic set up five years ago to provide researchers with engineering support for very small-scale devices, said that doctors initially asked him when he would start building tiny intelligent submarines -- minus the shrunken crew, of course. While researchers do discuss the feasibility of making tiny robotic devices able to maneuver inside the body and perform a variety of tasks, most current research and new product development is focused on nano-scale particles. Quantum dots, metallic particles that emit bright light in a color range that varies with their size, are now frequently used to study tumors and locate proteins that researchers want to study. By attaching antibodies that prefer to bind with specific types of cells to dots of different sizes, the researchers can get a multicolored image showing the location and concentration of many elements inside a tissue sample. Nanoparticles may help researchers overcome obstacles in gene therapy, which seeks to treat genetically inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis by implanting healthy genes to do the work of damaged ones. Nanoparticles may also be used to deliver heat to cancer cells to kill them. MagForce Technologies, based in Berlin, coats iron oxide nanoparticles with a compound that is a nutrient for tumor cells, which then ingest the particles. When an external magnetic field causes the particles to vibrate rapidly, the tumor cells are killed and then flushed from the body by its natural scavenger cells, according to MagForce's research results. MagForce expects regulatory approval to sell the particles and its treatment machinery in Germany in 2006 after more extensive clinical trials have been completed. A German insurer has already agreed to reimburse hospitals there for the technology, based on early results, according to Dr. Andreas Jordan, the company's chief executive. Dr. Jordan said he was negotiating with large American equipment vendors in hopes of finding a partner big enough to cope with the costs of getting regulatory and reimbursement approval in the United States. Business issues aside, researchers say, nanotechnology in medicine faces so many technical hurdles that long delays and numerous failures are inevitable. ''The complexity of biology is clearly beyond our comprehension at this time,'' said Dr. James R. Baker Jr., director of the Center for Biologic Nanotechnology at the University of Michigan. ''That's why so many drugs fail.''

Their story should have had a happy ending last week when Shopping.com -- the company formed in April 2003 by the merger of Epinions and a comparison-pricing site called DealTime -- went public. Shopping.com enjoyed the most successful first day of any initial offering in the United States since JetBlue went public in April 2002, according to Richard J. Peterson, the chief market strategist for Thomson Financial. But the founders of Epinions -- Nirav Tolia, Naval Ravikant, Ramanathan Guha, Dion Lim and Mike Speiser -- have learned that success does not necessarily mean that a company's creators will be rewarded. August Capital and Benchmark Capital, two venture capital firms that invested $4 million each to help start Epinions in April 1999, profited handsomely in the public offering. They had both made additional investments, and each now owns a stake in Shopping.com worth roughly $60 million. Overall, Shopping.com was worth $750 million at the close of the market on Friday. By contrast, four of the five founders of Epinions did not see a dime from Shopping.com's public sale -- their shares in Epinions were rendered worthless when it merged with DealTime. ''What the Epinions story demonstrates,'' said Paul Saffo, a research fellow at the Institute for the Future, a Silicon Valley research group, ''is that the golden rule applies even in Silicon Valley: the people who have the gold, rule.'' Of the Epinions founders, only Mr. Tolia, who took over as Shopping.com's chief operating officer after the merger, fared well in the offering. His shares were worth nearly $20 million at Friday's closing price. But Mr. Tolia's good fortune is not unmarred. In June, he resigned after the company ''became aware of inaccuracies in his representations about his work history and educational background,'' according to a Shopping.com press release. A biography distributed by Epinions in its early days stated that Mr. Tolia had a degree from Stanford University. A spokeswoman for Stanford, however, said in an interview that though Mr. Tolia had attended the college between 1990 and 1995, a degree was not conferred until last Sept. 30. Mr. Tolia also claimed he worked as an analyst at McKinsey & Company. ''We have no record of a Nirav Tolia ever working for us,'' a McKinsey spokesman said. Lou Montulli, a founding engineer at Netscape who joined Epinions three weeks after its inception, said, ''It's really hard for me to discern the real truth on all that happened. Not everything is clear, even to us.'' Mr. Tolia's credibility is an issue for Shopping.com, the company said in filings, as it braces for litigation tied to its merger with Epinions. Lawyers for at least 30 former Epinions employees, including Mr. Speiser and Mr. Ravikant, have told Shopping.com that they intend to sue over the valuation of stock options that they were awarded. Before the offering, Epinions had two classes of shares: common stock, which was granted to the founders and employees, and preferred shares, which were given to investors. Their preferred shares in Epinions entitled the financiers to be reimbursed the $45 million they had invested before anyone else was compensated. Today, the Epinions portion of Shopping.com is worth hundreds of millions, but at the time of the DealTime merger, Epinions was valued at roughly $30 million, which rendered all common shares worthless. ''The question we're asking,'' said one former Epinions employee who asked not to be identified and who plans to be part of the lawsuit, ''is how this company supposedly worth only $30 million was suddenly worth $300 million only 18 months later.'' The 70 or so former Epinions employees who were not hired by Shopping.com, the lawyers assert, are owed as much as 2.4 million shares of Shopping.com, a stake worth $65 million at Friday's closing price of $26.97 a share (the shares were initially priced at $18 each). Mr. Montulli, who said he had not decided if he would join the suit as a plaintiff, said, ''It's my understanding that it could be quite a large group joining that suit.'' At its peak, 120 people worked for Epinions; all were granted stock options. J. William Gurley, of Benchmark Capital, declined to comment on Epinions, citing the S.E.C.-mandated quiet period that extends for 25 days after a company's public offering. In April 2003, the California Department of Corporations found that the merger was ''fair, just and equitable to parties on both sides of the transaction.'' Mr. Tolia also declined to comment. But during a hearing in 2003 he said that it was ''always a bit of a tough feeling when one realizes it's the end of the road in terms of holding a piece of stock, and now that piece of stock will be worthless.'' Many former employees are critical of Mr. Tolia, including Joyce Park, who worked at Epinions from early 2000 until she was laid off in the spring of 2002. ''I think the surprise among most of us is that Nirav was the one to scoop up the whole pot,'' she said. ''Let's just say that to us he was the out-front guy, the charming guy who looked good on TV.'' Mr. Tolia was not the company's original chief executive, but he served in that position at the time of the merger. But Eric Goldman, Epinions' general counsel and now a law professor, said that Mr. Tolia was just doing his job in fashioning a merger with DealTime. ''Without Nirav's leadership, the company would not have survived,'' he said. ''So not only would those holding common stock have been annihilated, all the other investors would have been annihilated, too.'' That view was echoed by Dion Lim, one of the founders of Epinions. ''I believe that everything Nirav has done -- including layoffs, the merger, his resignation -- has been in the best interest of the company,'' Mr. Lim wrote in an e-mail message. The choice Mr. Tolia faced, Mr. Goldman said, was to accept an offer that would salvage some jobs at Epinions and reward the firm's investors, or see the company shut down. ''That doesn't mean people didn't get hurt,'' he said, ''and I'm speaking as one of them.'' TECHNOLOGY", "title": "The I.P.O. Succeeded.

But that does not mean that the idea of chips as personal identity tags will ever generate profits. The device, called the VeriChip and marketed by Applied Digital Solutions, horrified privacy advocates, who were concerned less with its F.D.A.-approved use than with where the technology might lead, declaring that people could become walking bar codes. Investors, however, piled into Applied Digital's stock, sending it up 68 percent, to $3.57, on Oct. 13, the day of the announcement. The shares, which are listed on the Nasdaq, later climbed as high as $4.62. On Friday, the shares closed at $4, up 19 cents, or 5 percent. Moving quickly to exploit the optimism, Applied Digital announced on Oct. 22 that it had raised $11.9 million in a private sale of 2.5 million shares at $3.61 a share, and warrants to buy nearly 2.2 million shares. The purchaser was Satellite Strategic Finance Associates, an investment company that bought $2 million of shares of Applied Digital in April. It is far from clear, however, whether the F.D.A. approval actually moved Applied Digital far enough toward its long-term vision to make it a less risky stock. Scott R. Silverman, Applied Digital's chairman and chief executive, said that investors in the company, which is based in Delray Beach, Fla., see VeriChip as ''the proverbial home run'' and said that he was not about to discourage that view. While he insisted that a revamping that the company had undergone has created a business that can survive without VeriChip, he said that ''Veri-Chip's what's going to deliver value to shareholders in the long run.'' The F.D.A.'s approval is for Veri-Chip's use in a system that would give health care workers quick access to the medical records of anyone who had been implanted with the device. But the average ballplayer has a far better chance of hitting a home run than the average investor has of picking big winners among the thousands of new technologies that small companies like Applied Digital are trying to take to the market. In this case, investors also face the challenge of understanding Applied Digital's intricate finances and relationships with its publicly traded subsidiaries, Digital Angel and Infotech USA. Digital Angel also cashed in on the jump in Applied Digital stock after the F.D.A.'s announcement, selling close to 1.07 million shares of Applied Digital for $4 million. That stock was obtained in March in a stock swap with Applied Digital. The complicated financial structure is tied to Applied Digital's past. Applied Digital grew out of a wireless communications venture called Applied Cellular Technology. Richard J. Sullivan, a veteran entrepreneur, became chief executive in 1993, took the company public in 1994 and engineered more than 50 acquisitions by 2002. Applied's stock soared to more than $151 a share early in 2000, then collapsed with the bursting telecommunications and Internet bubbles. Mr. Silverman, a lawyer and consultant, was named president in 2002 to help streamline Mr. Sullivan's money-losing hodgepodge. He succeeded Mr. Sullivan as chief executive last year. In addition to its stake in Digital Angel, which is based in South St. Paul, Minn., Applied Digital controls 52 percent of InfoTech USA, a computer services and networking firm based in Fairfield, N.J., that was formerly known as SysComm International. All three have been losing money, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Silverman recently summed up Applied Digital's status as ''much closer than ever before to net income.'' There is nothing modest about Applied Digital's vision for VeriChip. The company's executives have told investors that VeriChip is addressing markets worth hundreds of billions of dollars. VeriChip, they have said, could become the theft- and loss-proof successor to the credit card, a device to monitor the whereabouts of children and mentally impaired adults and a tool to prevent anyone other than a police officer from using a gun issued to the officer. But Applied has not demonstrated that it is technically feasible for Veri-Chip-driven data systems to operate at the reliability levels needed in most of the financial, security and medical uses bandied about by the company's enthusiasts. To be sure, Digital Angel and competitors like AllFlex USA and Avid Identification Systems have been using similar implanted radio tags to permit pet shelters, laboratories and veterinarians to identify millions of animals. But the infrastructure investment that would be needed to have a major impact on VeriChip's intended human markets is far larger and more complex. It is also difficult to see how Veri-Chip would compete economically with other available technologies. None of the alternatives do everything VeriChip can, but biometrics, like face and iris scans or fingerprints, and radio tags embedded in smart cards or wristbands have a head start toward commercialization. Generally, they are also less expensive to deploy than VeriChip. So far, VeriChip's biggest success has been in Mexico, where several hundred Mexicans have enrolled in a version of the medical application that was approved by the F.D.A. in the United States. A smaller group, which includes Rafael Macedo de la Concha, Mexico's attorney general, were implanted with chips to control access to documents vital to the battle with drug traffickers. Mr. Silverman said the F.D.A. clearance would unlock the domestic medical business, which he said was VeriChip's best application. But the F.D.A. approval limits the chip to encoding a 16-digit identification. The chip cannot carry such basic data as blood type or organ donor instructions, and it is useless if the health care worker does not have the scanner and a computer or other means of accessing electronic records. The approval letter from the F.D.A. also contains ominous warnings about potential risks, like migration of the implanted chip and interference with magnetic resonance imaging device, which are widely used in hospitals. There is no evidence that such possibilities are problems with VeriChip, but critics hope such warnings will help scare off the big medical products companies that Applied Digital desperately needs to sign on as distributors. Given Applied Digital's complexity, some investors said that Digital Angel was a less risky way to invest in VeriChip's potential. Digital Angel owns the underlying technology, which it licenses to Applied Digital, and manufactures VeriChip along with its animal tracking devices. Applied Digital's license runs out in 2013, so even if VeriChip grows into a major product, Applied's grasp over its long-range returns may be shaky. Digital Angel's shares, which closed at $2.71 the day before the F.D.A. approval of VeriChip, ended trading Friday at $3.53. David Talbot, a portfolio manager for Healthvest Advisors, which first invested in Digital Angel three years ago, said new management installed at Digital Angel has steered the company toward profitability. Mr. Talbot said that he believed the animal tagging business alone was worth more than Digital Angel's current stock price. But when asked about relations between the Applied Digital companies, he added, ''I wish it wasn't so convoluted.''

But is it really a merger? Controversy is building in London over the answer to that question. At stake are bragging rights for the investment banks that top the rankings, known as ''league tables,'' based on who did the most business in mergers and acquisitions for the year. The Shell deal officially combines two publicly traded entities, Royal Dutch Petroleum and Shell Transport and Trading, into one publicly traded company, and streamlines its management. But for most practical purposes the companies have been working as one since 1907, when they first agreed to combine. They sorted out many of the big issues that surround most mergers decades ago. Citigroup, which served as the lead bank on the deal, advising both Royal Dutch Petroleum and Shell Transport and Trading, thinks the transaction counts as a merger. Thomson Financial, one compiler of league tables, agreed, adding $80 billion to the tally of Citigroup's deal-making business this year. That made Citigroup the second-largest mergers and acquisitions adviser of the year, up from No.4, in Thomson's rankings. But Dealogic, another league table compiler, refused to give Citigroup credit. And at least three other investment banks are actively lobbying Thomson to remove the Shell revamping from its league tables because they say it unfairly skews the rankings. Michael Maclure, director for mergers and acquisitions at Dealogic, said the transaction was ''the collapse of a dual-listing structure,'' and shareholders get the same economic interest as they had beforehand. ''From that point of view, there is no M.&A. activity,'' he said. ''There was a deal between the Dutch and the British companies, which occurred in 1907,'' Mr. Maclure added. ''Credit should have been apportioned back then'' for any investment banking advice, he said. Investment bankers who are not working at Citigroup agree that the transaction is not a merger. ''Share class reclassification should not be recognized as M.&A. activity,'' said one energy banker based in London. ''Thomson is getting intensely lobbied by multiple firms'' to take away Citigroup's $80 billion credit, he said, but the success of that lobbying is not guaranteed. ''Sometimes these guys get stubborn,'' the banker said. Citigroup said it had no comment on the controversy. Thomson Financial's European director for deals, Paul Sandell, said the deal met Thomson's criteria for a merger because it involved an exchange of shares. (Shareholders from Royal Dutch and Shell Transport are each being given different classes of shares in the new company.) This type of controversy is nothing new, Mr. Sandell said. In any deal, if ''the structure is somewhat muddled or unusual, there is substantial interest from investment banks'' about how it will be ranked in the league tables, he said. Some said the controversy was another sign that these types of rankings were meaningless. ''I don't think volume-based league tables are valid,'' said Vasco Moreno, the banking research director for the takeover adviser Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.", "title": "Did Shell Merge?

Few, though, would expect a TV -- or a garage door opener, or a photocopier -- to issue a cry for help. Early last month, Chris van Rossman's television silently began to malfunction, emitting a signal that bounced off two satellites, alerted personnel at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, and ultimately led a team of local sheriff's deputies and Civil Air Patrol volunteers to the door of his apartment in Corvallis, Ore. He was advised to keep the TV turned off to avoid incurring $10,000 a day in fines for emitting a false distress signal. The television's maker, Toshiba, is replacing the set that cried wolf. The TV -- like refrigerators, shavers and vacuum cleaners -- was simply doing what all electrical gizmos do: emitting energy. On this particular Saturday night, however, some hidden bit of the television's electronic innards simply went on the blink. And while the set appeared to be functioning normally, it was suddenly oozing energy at a frequency -- 121.5 megahertz -- that happens to be reserved for international distress signals. Each year, thousands of distress signals send rescuers around the globe scrambling. More often than not, the signals lead not to an emergency, but to an unintentionally activated distress beacon on a plane, aboard a ship, or in the backpack of a mountain climber. Now and then, though, the errant signal comes from a malfunctioning appliance. Incidents like the one in Oregon, which was first reported by The Corvallis Gazette-Times, in fact, have played a part in nudging the international search-and-rescue community away from the 121.5 frequency that, among other shortcomings, is subject to interference from electronic devices gone bad. Officials say that by 2009, when search-and-rescue agencies plan to stop monitoring the old frequency, the aim is to have all emergency beacons emit a digital signal on a new frequency of 406 megahertz. While the new system will not be immune to false alarms, its signal will be distinguishable from the electromagnetic chatter of a pizza oven. Yes, that has happened too. ''It's not as bizarre as you would imagine,'' said Maj. Allan Knox, the assistant director of operations at the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center at Langley Air Force Base. ''We see it a couple times a year.'' In 2000, for instance, the emergency system started receiving weekly distress calls from Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium in Fayetteville, Ark., after the University of Arkansas unveiled a new, 30 feet by 107 feet SmartVision scoreboard. Its video processor system, it seems, was emitting spurious signals on the 121.5 frequency. National agencies like the Federal Communications Commission or global bodies like the International Telecommunications Union strive to prevent this kind of thing. They are the traffic cops on the electromagnetic superhighway, ensuring that everything, whether a baby monitor, FM radio broadcast or distress signal, stays in its lane. And while regulations and product testing help keep signals from running into one another, the increasingly dense forest of electronic gadgetry on the planet raises the odds of inadvertent signal leakage. ''It doesn't surprise me that a TV set is emitting signals in some band in which it is not supposed to be transmitting,'' said Peter B. Ladkin, a professor of computer science at the University of Bielefeld in Germany who studies signal interference. Although he was surprised to learn that the signal managed to bleed into such a highly regulated part of the spectrum, random emissions of energy, Professor Ladkin said, are par for the course. ''That happens all the time with personal electronics,'' he said in an e-mail message. ''There are numerous reports of passenger electronics interfering with navigational displays in the cockpits of commercial aircraft, going back decades.'' That is partly why search-and-rescue organizations want to do away with using the 121.5 frequency for international distress signals. Before the 1970's, finding a downed aircraft in a remote region was a needle-in-a-haystack venture. So after a small plane carrying two members of Congress vanished over Alaska in 1970, Congress required that all civilian aircraft in the United States carry emergency locator beacons. Those early beacons, designed for both manual and, in the event of a crash, automatic activation, were to broadcast their signals at 121.5 MHz -- the distress frequency long used by aviators. Search-and-rescue planes could then tune their radios to that frequency and home in on the signal. The system worked well enough, but satellite technology adopted in the 1980's expanded coverage and made the system truly global. Anticipating those developments, four nations -- the United States, Canada, France and the Soviet Union -- rallied around the promise of satellites and formed an organization known as Cospas-Sarsat in 1979. (Sarsat stands for Search-and-Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking; Cospas is the Russian equivalent.) The new 406 MHz frequency was adopted to work specifically with satellites. Where the old radio beacons were little more than crude homing devices, the newer frequency permits beacons to send digital signals with identifying information that can speed rescue time and eliminate false alarms from, say, malfunctioning outdoor Christmas lights. (Yes, really.) The older radio frequency, however, is still widely used, and Cospas-Sarsat, which now has 35 members and dozens of monitoring stations around the globe, has had to monitor both channels for the last two decades. So the organization is printing pamphlets, setting up Web sites and otherwise spreading the gospel of the 406 frequency. And it is reminding pilots and sailors around the world that after Feb. 1, 2009, no rescuer will respond to the 121.5 help line. One factor hindering upgrades, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the Sarsat system in the United States, is that the modern units are more expensive, costing about $1,500, while old beacons broadcasting at 121.5 can be had for less than $500. Still, the higher cost can be justified. The F.A.A. estimates that 134 extra lives and millions of dollars in search-and-rescue resources could be saved each year if everyone switched to the 406 frequency. That's not to say, of course, that using the digital signal will eliminate false alarms. In the United States alone, 369 -- or 3 percent -- of the more than 12,000 distress signals using the older frequency in 2003 proved to be real emergencies. But the record is not much better with new beacons: of the more than 3,000 signals that went up at 406 MHz last year, only 167, or 5 percent, were distress situations. While that sounds pretty ineffective, rescue officials say that is just the nature of the beast. ''It's true for 911 calls. It's true for just about any distress alerting system,'' said Ajay Mehta, the program coordinator for Sarsat in Suitland, Md. Even in a system that responds exclusively to signals at the 406 MHz frequency, the vast majority of calls will come from inadvertently activated beacons, Mr. Mehta said, and there will still be random signals from other devices bleeding into the 406 range. But if a signal is not carrying a digital ID, operators will know that it is not an emergency beacon and rescue forces will not be dispatched. He also said that a few weeks of TV-free living have been, in their own way, liberating. ''I've managed to get out of the house more often,'' he said. ''So that's a good thing.'' Correction:  November 9, 2004, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Nov. 1 about a malfunctioning television set that emitted distress signals misattributed a comment about the owners' change in routine after the set was removed and before it was replaced. It was Chris van Rossman, the owner, who said a few weeks of TV-free living had been liberating -- not Ajay Mehta, program coordinator for the satellite search and rescue system that monitors distress beacons.", "title": "The TV That Sent Out a Cry for Help, via Satellite"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/Technology", "Top/News/Business", "Top/News/Business/Media and Advertising", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Oregon", "Top/News/U.S./Northwest", "Top/News", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Technology, Telecommunications and Internet", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Media, Entertainment and Publishing", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Oregon"], "publication_day_of_month": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Technology; Business", "publication_month": "11", "correction_date": "20041109T000000", "dsk": "Business/Financial Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Monday", "print_section": "C", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/01/technology/01signal.html", "print_column": "2", "banner": "Correction Appended", "slug": "01SIGN$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "The federal court in Brooklyn is no stranger to stock fraud cases. But while the federal court in Manhattan typically gets the headline-grabbing Wall Street and corporate accounting scandals, the Brooklyn court is often home to the grittier, more shadowy investing world of penny stocks. One of the more unusual of these cases goes to trial today. Anthony Elgindy, who for more than a decade has been a controversial figure in the world of cheap and thinly traded stocks of small companies, is accused of conspiring with an F.B.I. agent to obtain information about government investigations and using that information to manipulate stock prices. Prosecutors contend that Mr. Elgindy also used that information to persuade companies to pay for his silence. But the case against Mr. Elgindy, who was known as Amr Ibrahim Elgindy before legally changing his name last year, has also attracted attention because of a prosecutor's suggestion at the time of his arrest in May 2002 that Mr. Elgindy might have had prior knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks. At a court hearing that month, the prosecutor, Kenneth Breen, said that Mr. Elgindy, who was born in Egypt, contacted an unidentified broker at Salomon Smith Barney on Sept. 10, 2001. Predicting that the Dow Jones industrial average would soon collapse by about two-thirds, the prosecutor said that Mr. Elgindy asked the broker to sell $300,000 in his children's trust funds. Mr. Elgindy, however, was unable to sell that day and did not sell until the markets reopened for trading on Sept. 18. ''Perhaps Mr. Elgindy had pre-knowledge of Sept. 11, and rather than report it, he attempted to profit from it,'' Mr. Breen said at the hearing. Mr. Elgindy's lawyers have called the contention ludicrous, and the judge at the hearing disregarded it. Prosecutors have not since raised the possibility of a link, and Mr. Breen declined to comment about that assertion and all other matters related to the case before opening statements begin today. The trial in Brooklyn may be the end of a long dance Mr. Elgindy has had with regulators and prosecutors. In the early 1990's, Mr. Elgindy, who had worked at several so-called pump-and-dump brokerage firms, confessed to authorities that he and others had accepted bribes from stock promoters seeking to manipulate shares. In exchange for immunity, he agreed to work as a government informant. At a time of rampant fraud in penny stocks, Mr. Elgindy showed investigators how the schemes worked and helped prosecutors win several convictions for white-collar crimes. Around the same time, though, Mr. Elgindy defrauded an insurance company by collecting disability benefits while working at two Texas brokerage offices in 1994 and 1995. In 2000, he was convicted and served four months in federal prison. By the late 1990's, Mr. Elgindy, who also went by the names Tony Elgindy and Anthony Pacific, had gained a loyal Internet following as a stock picker, selling tips for $600 a month. And he carved out a new role for himself: a short seller, or one who bets on a decline in a stock price, who was not afraid to tell the truth about corrupt companies and shady promoters. At the same time, according to the indictment, Mr. Elgindy and his associates had ''corruptly induced'' an F.B.I. agent for personal gain. Mr. Elgindy's lawyers contend that their client is a victim of Justice Department and Wall Street venom for his own corporate detective work. ''Like Howard Stern on the radio, he outgrew the government,'' said Joel R. Isaacson, one of the two lawyers representing Mr. Elgindy. ''He was just too much of a personality, and he was like the little boy at the parade that kept pointing out the emperor's naked. ''He developed a lot of enemies and a million allegations have been made against him. We are looking forward to getting into a courtroom and responding.'' The jury trial is expected to take about six weeks. It comes more than two years after Mr. Elgindy and four associates were arrested and faced charges related to obstruction of justice and securities fraud. Jeffrey A. Royer, an F.B.I. agent who is accused of going into the agency's confidential databases to provide Mr. Elgindy with tips and eventually became a business partner, will be tried with him. Jonathan Daws, a hedge fund operator; Lynn Wingate, a former F.B.I agent; and Troy M. Peters, a stock trader, are expected to stand trial separately sometime next year. Derrick W. Cleveland, another trader who worked with Mr. Elgindy, has pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. But Mr. Elgindy, who has been in jail since last April after trying to board a domestic flight with two fake identification cards, remains at the center of this case. In the 33-page indictment, prosecutors contend that between November 2000 and May 2002, Mr. Royer was paid to provide Mr. Elgindy and Mr. Cleveland with information obtained from confidential government databases about the criminal histories and continuing investigations of tiny, publicly traded companies. Based on that information, the complaint said, Mr. Elgindy and Mr. Cleveland sold the stock of those companies short -- borrowed and then immediately sold shares in anticipation of buying them back at a lower price for a profit. Mr. Elgindy then published the negative information on two Web sites he operated, hoping the price would plummet further. Federal prosecutors also charge that Mr. Elgindy and his associates engaged in extortion, telling several small companies they would disclose bad news about them if they did not give them heavily discounted, and sometimes free, stock. Mr. Elgindy's lawyer said his client often investigated fraudulent companies on his own and noted that the information he obtained, though negative, was often truthful. ''Working hand-in-hand with many government agents, he learned of many phony companies, and he did not ever believe that he was being given confidential or secret information that he shouldn't have,'' Mr. Isaacson said. Federal prosecutors, however, are expected to tell a somewhat different story during the trial. Mr. Elgindy and his associates, the indictment said, were manipulating the market by ''trading on material, nonpublic information that had been misappropriated from law enforcement databases.''", "title": "Broker Who Aided U.S. Going on Trial For Fraud"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/Business", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/New York", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Washington, D.C.", "Top/News/U.S./Mid-Atlantic", "Top/News", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Banking, Finance and Insurance", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Manufacturing, Operations and Logistics", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Washington, D.C.", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/New York/New York City"], "publication_day_of_month": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Business", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Business/Financial Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Monday", "print_section": "C", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/01/business/01trial.html", "print_column": "5", "slug": "01TRIA$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "The Pacific And Other Stories  By Mark Helprin  366 pages. The Penguin Press. $25.95. There is water, water everywhere in Mark Helprin's soggy new collection of stories. Whether it takes the form of the Atlantic or the Pacific, a Venetian canal or a Canadian snowfield, water plays a symbolic role in virtually every one of these tales -- an emblem of the obliviousness of the physical world, and the possibility of renewal and redemption. It is a metaphor for Nature, for Eternity, for Life and for Death; a reminder that Mr. Helprin is interested not in the minutiae of daily life but in the Big Picture and big questions about truth and goodness and mortality. In the past, this outlook -- together with a prodigious imagination -- has resulted in some potent fiction: the fierce, faintly surreal improvisations of ''Ellis Island and Other Stories'' (1981) and the haunting, picaresque reminiscences of a war veteran in ''A Soldier of the Great War'' (1991). But this time, in ''The Pacific and Other Stories,'' Mr. Helprin's focus on moral absolutes seems to have hardened, if not calcified, and most of his philosophical excursions into fable-land result in heavy-handed, stage-managed fictions -- works hobbled by simplistic, Manichean juxtapositions of good and evil, the noble past and the debased present. The lugubrious tale ''Jacob Bayer and the Telephone,'' for instance, pits a modest, truth-seeking teacher named Jacob against a bunch of philistines who worship the telephone; it bludgeons home the author's point that tradition is admirable, while blind belief in progress and technology is stupid. ''Reconstruction'' similarly juxtaposes a bunch of spoiled, acquisitive yuppies with a man's memories of his father, a World War II veteran and certified member of the Greatest Generation. Mr. Helprin -- who, in addition to writing fiction, has written speeches for former Senator Bob Dole and political columns for The Wall Street Journal -- tends to view things, in these stories, in black-and-white, all-or-nothing terms. As a result, his heroes often emerge as cardboard exemplars of virtue. Many are preoccupied with lofty matters like how to die with honor, how to serve God, how to remain true to their ideals. In ''Perfection,'' Roger Reveshze, a 14-year-old Holocaust survivor who becomes obsessed with the Yankees because they dwell in ''the house of Ruth,'' helps the Bronx Bombers to a series of stunning wins with his divinely inspired baseball skills; in doing so, he makes his teammates play not for the sake of winning but for the sake of perfection, as a means of speaking ''directly to God.'' In ''Monday,'' a saintly New York City contractor named Fitch -- who is ''faultlessly honest'' and always ''gave reasonable estimates, did the highest-quality work, finished on time'' -- decides to spend his own money to renovate an apartment for a woman who lost her husband in the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Self-conscious, even self-congratulatory about his good deed, Fitch feels that the project imbues him and his men with a sense of holiness. Predictably enough, their ''sacrificial labor'' results in a masterpiece: ''It was a refuge, and yet it was not closed. It was a fortress, and yet it was light and airy. It was luxurious, and yet it was modest and austere.'' This self-important, sentimental language extends to the story's dialogue as well. ''You know,'' Fitch asks a colleague, ''how knights would die for the Virgin, would yearn to die? And how everything in the world seemed unimportant next to their peculiar, settled, certain devotion?'' When Gustavo replies that ''that is still very much in the heart of my country,'' Fitch goes on: ''Well, then you know. Sometimes you find something that's truly important, and even though it throws everything into disorder you know you have to do it and it gives you new life.'' As readers of the author's earlier fiction well know, Mr. Helprin is highly skilled at creating dramatic sequences that are prickly with suspense, and this volume is no exception. ''Mar Nueva'' recounts a chilling showdown between an autocratic tyrant and an outspoken and idealistic young woman who dares to stand up to him. While ''A Brilliant Idea and His Own'' provides a harrowing account of a British parachutist's efforts to cope with the injuries he's received during a bad jump behind enemy lines and his heroic attempts to radio back intelligence to his comrades in arms. But these stories, by far the strongest in this volume, feel more like bravura set pieces than full-fledged, emotionally satisfying fictions. As for the remaining tales, they tend to be a cloying, synthetic lot. Some pivot heavily around a terrible irony: a Jewish music hall performer decides to travel to Poland on the eve of Hitler's march through Europe. Others feature contrived O. Henryesque twist endings: a man, who is obsessed with his luxurious, perfect house, loses it to a fire; years after discovering a great opera star, an impresario stumbles across another amazing young talent but instead of instantly signing her decides to warn her about the perils of fame. At once predictable and unbelievable, these stories not only fail to provide a durable showcase for Mr. Helprin's instinctive gifts as a storyteller, but they also point up a growing sanctimony and schematism to his writing.

But it was a pleasure to discover, beneath the general onstage bellowing at the Metropolitan Opera on Saturday afternoon, the Met orchestra and its conductor of the day, Dennis Russell Davies, playing Mascagni and Leoncavallo with exquisite sensibility. This was, of course, ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' and its inseparable sidekick, ''Pagliacci,'' in one of Franco Zeffirelli's earlier exercises in grandiosity. Belovedness is a two-edged sword. So irresistibly enthralled are audiences by these two violent little beauties that standards of fineness, vocal health and musical faithfulness can easily slip a few degrees with little notice. The Met does not give these productions front-line casts. The thrall is understandable. The opening sequence of ''Cavalleria'' is a crowd scene managed with a grace not often found in opera. The famous moments of ''Pagliacci'' are justly famous, and the murderous play that is not a play at the end is a theatrical coup. Both operas hinge on love triangles, ''Pagliacci'' perhaps being the more overwrought and contrived of the two. Music criticism, on the other hand, doesn't mean much next to the sheer lyrical invention that sweeps across an afternoon like this. Eva Urbanova, as Santuzza, wielded the most substantial of the ''Cavalleria'' voices. Jane Shaulis (Mama Lucia) and Jossie P\u00e9rez (Lola) did nicely. Canio in ''Pagliacci'' came by way of Vladimir Galouzine's full-throttle tenor. He, like Fabio Armiliato (Turiddu) and Frederick Burchinal (Alfio) in the other opera, gave us dynamic spectra ranging between loud and louder. All three had a cavalierness toward note value, tempo and phrase length that kept Mr. Davies in the pit playing nervous games of tag with his singers. Juan Pons played the thwarted Tonio to Leoncavallo's melodramatic hilt in ''Pagliacci,'' while Daniela Dess\u00ec (Nedda), Philippe Castagner (Beppe) and Mariusz Kwiecien (Silvio) were all respectable. The principal player in ''Cavalleria'' was really Mr. Zeffirelli's steep, high set of stone steps leading to the church. An opera may have been going on, but the eye wandered uncontrollably back to them: how small people looked during ascent and descent. How did set builders achieve that wonderful, worn unevenness? Would anyone slip and fall? There were also children and live animals to take the mind off music. The double bill of ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' and ''Pagliacci'' will return to the Metropolitan Opera on Wednesday, Saturday, Nov. 10 and 13 and March 20 and 26.

It has been five years since his pretty-good solo debut, and he has released only a handful of (not very good) tracks. And yet he is regularly lionized as one of hip-hop most important voices, as a socially conscious visionary, as a fearless musical explorer. None of these claims are borne out by his spotty discography, but no matter: who needs new releases when you've got a reputation like that? It's not really fair to blame Mos Def for his reputation -- and besides, he has spent the last few years establishing himself as an actor (most notably in the play ''Topdog/Underdog''). But we can certainly blame him for ''The New Danger'' (Geffen), the long-awaited follow-up to his 1999 debut, ''Black on Both Sides.'' This new album should help close the gap between his myth and his music, although probably not in the way he might have liked. It seems the album was meant to evoke a long, hazy jam session, ambitious but laid-back, with tense rock 'n' roll rants and atmospheric ballads and head-nodding hip-hop all wafting in and out of the mix. But although Mos Def sometimes finds the casual groove he's looking for, this disc is surprisingly dreary and oddly abstract. A lot of times it sounds as if we are hearing an idea for a song rather than a song itself. When he wants to make a ghettocentric rock song, he grabs a simple guitar loop, a basic hip-hop beat, and chants, ''Yes, we are so ghetto/Yes, we are rock 'n' roll.'' (That song, by the way, is \"Ghetto Rock.\") And when he wants hip-hop fans to know that he's, y'know, real, he records a track called ''Life Is Real,'' which goes, ''My whole life is real/Mornings, noons and nights is real/What I spit and I write is real/'Cause my life is ill.'' What's most puzzling about this album is the lack of the warmth and wit for which Mos Def is known. The album's low point is ''The Rape Over,'' for which Mos Def recycles a three-year-old Jay-Z beat while complaining, angrily but rather vaguely, about the ''old white men,'' ''corporate forces'' and ''quasihomosexuals'' controlling hip-hop. Plenty of rappers and singers are at their best when they are at their grouchiest, but not this one. A few of the more traditional rap tracks work, including ''Sunshine,'' with an effective Kanye West beat, and ''War,'' which has a greasy sideways groove that comes from Psycho Les of the Beatnuts (although it soon devolves into an unpleasant rap-metal harangue). But the long, allegedly soulful tracks often meander, especially ''Modern Marvel,'' a nine-minute Marvin Gaye tribute that includes this unfortunate couplet: ''When he said, 'Mercy, Mercy,' did he really know/That decades later, we'd still be killing folk?'' If this is what socially conscious hip-hop sounds like, then thank goodness lots of rappers avoid it altogether. 'Unfinished Business'  R. Kelly and Jay-Z This just might be the most cursed partnership in the history of popular music. \"Best of Both Worlds,\" the first album by these two, was torpedoed by Mr. Kelly's child-pornography scandal. After Mr. Kelly made his astonishing comeback (although he still faces 14 charges of child pornography), the two decided to revive a bad idea, and embarked on the disastrous tour that flamed out on Friday night at Madison Square Garden. The post-show interviews on Hot 97 (WQHT-FM, 97.1) made for some of the most entertaining hip-hop radio programming ever: Jay-Z complained about his ''insecure'' and ''disrespectful'' co-headliner, while Mr. Kelly said that he thought he had seen guns in the crowd, and added that he had been attacked by pepper spray, perhaps by a member of Jay-Z's entourage. Right now some enterprising bootlegger is probably working on a CD compilation of this radio play, ''War of the (Best of Both) Worlds.'' Oh yeah: the now-estranged super-duo has also released a CD, ''Unfinished Business'' (Jive/Rock Land/Roc-a-Fella/Island Def Jam), a brazenly lightweight collaboration between a pair of unapologetic hustlers who could probably do this in their sleep -- and, for the most part, might have. Yet somehow, this album is delicious from start to end, filled with penny-candy grooves, gold-plated pickup lines, and even a few moments of high drama. (O.K., low drama. What's wrong with that?) The track ''Feelin' You in Stereo'' gives Mr. Kelly a chance to run yet another absurd sexual metaphor into the ground. (''Girl, you a mix master/When it comes to bumping, you a ghetto blaster/It's such a hit/That I gotta bootleg it.'') ''Stop'' has Jay-Z rattling off some nimble boilerplate (''I do somersaults with lines when someone insults my grind/From Marcy to partying with the sultan of Brunei'') over a double-Dutch-inspired beat. The mood is casual, even slack, and at the end of the horn-driven strut called ''Big Chips'' Mr. Kelly ad-libs some nonsense about vacationing on an island, adding, ''I think I just saw a dolphin.'' But there is one exception: ''Don't Let Me Die,'' a wild and impassioned dose of hard-swinging gospel; when Mr. Kelly sobs, ''I feel like it's 20 of me/Going 20 different directions on a one-way street,'' he seems genuinely terrified. Sometimes, bad ideas sound pretty good.

So naturally, mystified opera buffs are abuzz with speculation over the unexpected announcement that Peter Gelb, a recording executive who during years of economic woe for the industry kept the Sony Classical label afloat with hugely profitable crossover projects and film soundtracks, will be the Met's next general manager, succeeding Joseph Volpe in 2006. But before knowing what to make of Mr. Gelb's appointment, we have to ask what exactly the job will involve in the post-Volpe era? There is a relatively standard set of skills required to manage an orchestra, whether it's the New York Philharmonic or the Santa Rosa Symphony. Opera is a much more complicated endeavor, and different companies demand different mixes of skills from chief executives. If the company has a strong artistic director or a principal conductor with wide authority, then it may need a whiz-bang administrator. But at some opera companies the general manager is the de facto artistic director, especially regarding matters of production and staging. Much is being made of Mr. Gelb's inexperience in running an institution as complicated as the Met. Can he handle union negotiations, oversee fund-raising drives, cultivate good relations with the board and head a staff of 850 full-time and 1,200 part-time employees? I don't doubt that after working for a preparatory year under Mr. Volpe, an unabashed micromanager who started at the company as a carpenter, Mr. Gelb will get the hang of things. But what will his artistic priorities be? This question can't be answered without knowing what James Levine intends his own role to be now that his title has been downsized from artistic director to music director. Will Mr. Levine, busy in his new job as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and Mr. Gelb divvy up the artistic responsibilities? It's not yet clear -- not even, I suspect, to them. The Met as an institution and opera fans everywhere can only be grateful that Mr. Levine has devoted himself so intensely to the company for more than 30 years. Still, one fair criticism of his tenure is that in the last decade or so he has not been as involved as an artistic director should be with the overall artistic profile of the company, at least for the nights when he has not been on the podium. Mr. Levine has tended to pick his battles. It was crucial to him that the Met become a company where major works of the 20th century, like Berg's ''Wozzeck'' and ''Lulu'' and Stravinsky's ''Rake's Progress,'' turned up at least as often as repertory works like Verdi's ''Trovatore'' or Wagner's ''Tannh\u00e4user.'' And when he felt it essential for the company to make a major artistic statement, Mr. Levine usually got his way. For example, the Berlioz bicentenary was acknowledged with a superbly cast and ambitious new production of the epic ''Les Troyens'' and a colorful Met premiere production of the unfamiliar ''Benvenuto Cellini.'' But as a tradeoff, Mr. Levine has willingly let others, including Mr. Volpe, decide how often to bring back ''Tosca,'' or what director to hire for a new production of ''Carmen.'' Mr. Levine's other concession, a more serious one, has been to back off from pushing the Met to commission new works and present significant recent operas introduced elsewhere. Mr. Levine's interest in contemporary music is a genuine passion, not an intellectual pose. But as of this fall, he has another outlet for contemporary music: the Boston Symphony. To judge from the ecstatic reaction to Mr. Levine's inaugural concert on Oct. 22 (an exhilarating performance of Mahler's mighty Eighth Symphony), Boston audiences are thrilled to have him. And to judge from the programs he is conducting this season, rich with works by Gyorgy Ligeti, Lutoslawski and Schoenberg, and premieres by Elliott Carter, Charles Wuorinen, Milton Babbitt and John Harbison, the orchestra's directors and players support Mr. Levine's adventurous vision. Given the bracing challenges that await him in Boston, it is hard to imagine his getting too excited about conducting the new production of Gounod's ''Faust'' at the Met this season. My guess is that if he stays healthy and fulfills his commitment to the Met through 2011, his focus will still inexorably shift to Boston. Mr. Gelb would thus be in position to fill any vacuum. I had hoped that Mr. Volpe's successor would be someone interested in cultivating opera as a continuing art form. Mr. Gelb has been quick to blame the problems facing classical music -- aging audiences, lack of interest among young people, the calcification of the repertory -- on elitist composers, academics and critics who espouse, as he sees it, cerebral, complex music that nobody wants to hear. He has called for a revolution in programming that will be sympathetic to ''accessible'' music of broader appeal. You never hear theater impresarios complaining that challenging, literate and brainy plays like Michael Frayn's ''Copenhagen'' and Tom Stoppard's ''Invention of Love'' are not accessible or that they lack audience appeal. But directors of orchestras and opera companies routinely blame their own timidity on supposedly resistant audiences. In my experience, when an opera company really believes in a challenging new work, and when that conviction comes through in the production and the performance, audiences will respond. Part of the excitement of attending the premiere of Kaija Saariaho's mesmerizing and musically compelling ''Amour de Loin'' at the Salzburg Festival in 2000 and the premiere of Thomas Ad\u00e8s's brash and audacious adaptation of Shakespeare's ''Tempest'' this year came from being among listeners who sensed that we were attending the birth of formidable and authentic new works. Mr. Gelb surely knows Ms. Saariaho's music, for there is a splendid 2001 Sony Classical recording of several of her works, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen. Will Mr. Gelb bring Ms. Saariaho's opera to the Met? And Mr. Ad\u00e8s's? And other significant recent operas? What about future commissions? It's hard to know what role Mr. Levine played in commissioning the next two operas the Met will unveil (by Tobias Picker and Tan Dun), since he is not scheduled to conduct either work. Will he and Mr. Gelb find it easier to agree on composers? These questions matter to the future of the Met just as much as who directs the next new production of Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle. The Met has made its choice, and Mr. Gelb, an accomplished executive, deserves a chance to prove himself. But please, Mr. Gelb, no crossover opera!

Slashing the cost of tickets for the Olivier, the largest of the National's three auditoriums, to about the price of a movie was either going to lure a whole new group of people who hadn't been to the theater before or it was going to lose a whole lot of money. Now after a year and a half it's clear that Mr. Hytner has turned out to be a winner. The traditionally hard-to-fill 1,100-seat Olivier has lured in new theatergoers and averaged a 95 percent attendance rate during the cut-rate ticket season. With Travelex, the world's largest foreign-exchange specialist, as the sponsor, the Olivier has been able to offer two-thirds of its seats for \u00a310 (about $18). The rest of the seats are sold for $45, instead of the usual $65 for the top ticket. The \u00a310 Season will end on Nov. 6 and then start up again in the spring when Sir Michael Gambon stars as Falstaff in Shakespeare's two ''Henry IV'' plays. What's more, many in the audience are first-time buyers. One-third of those who last year saw Mr. Hytner's acclaimed production of ''Henry V,'' which inaugurated the first Travelex season, had never been to the National, he pointed out . ''I could not imagine overnight the audience would be so different, but it was, the minute they started coming for 'Henry V,''' Mr. Hytner said. The 2,200-seat Royal Opera House has had similar results with its much smaller program of opera and ballet performances. During an evening performance of the Jules Massenet opera ''Werther'' in September, Tony Hall, the Opera House's chief executive reported that 98 of the 100 spectators allotted seats had never been there before. ''If we're custodians or enthusiasts for these two art forms,'' he said, referring to opera and ballet, ''then we also want to attract for the art form's sake new people to come see what we're doing.'' The increase in Olivier audiences has carried over into the building's two smaller auditoriums. For the financial year 2003-04, total attendance at the National was 731,000, or 91 percent of capacity. That figure represents an 11 percent increase over the previous year and a 19 percent increase over the 1999-2000 financial year. Now instead of losing $900,000, as was expected, the National is showing a tiny but significant surplus of about $90,000. The Travelex sponsorship outlay for the Opera House is exactly the same as for the National: \u00a31 million over three years, or about $600,000 a year. Obviously ticket price isn't the only reason. Quite a few of the eight Olivier productions that were sponsored were critically acclaimed. ''Henry V,'' for instance, resonated during the early days of American and British troop involvement in Iraq. And Mr. Hytner's current production of David Hare's ''Stuff Happens,'' about the relations between President Bush and Britain's Tony Blair in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, is one of the most talked-about shows of the season. So what can Broadway learn from this? After all, at its most benevolent, Broadway tends to limit discounts to seats down front at various musicals -- they are $20, for example, at ''Rent'' -- so audiences can peer up their favorite performer's nostrils. Yet theater executives here and in New York agree that the program wouldn't survive the trans-Atlantic journey. As Nick Starr, the National's executive director and Mr. Hytner's No. 2, said, the ''costs on Broadway were too high to entertain such an audaciously low ticket price.'' Broadway productions typically cost millions of dollars. Yet even with a cast of 22, ''Stuff Happens'' had a standard per-production budget of about $135,000, in keeping with a stripped-down aesthetic throughout the April-to-November \u00a310 Season. The lone musical in the Travelex program, this summer's favorably reviewed revival of ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' directed by Edward Hall, cost $270,000, its budget supplemented by a separate National fund intended specifically for musicals. ''The moral,'' Mr. Hytner said, ''is that the size of the budget doesn't matter; if you deal with the space imaginatively and successfully, everybody's happy.'' That list of people includes executives at Travelex, who had been focusing their sponsorship on sports until the National came to call. ''What the scheme is and how it's implemented has to be innovative, and clearly the \u00a310 Season was,'' said Anthony Wagerman, the company's head of group marketing and communications. Second and wildly important, theater is subsidized in Britain. Currently, the National receives 38 percent of its annual income, or over $25 million, from the government. ''One of the reasons we wanted to do this is that it sends out the most fantastically clear message about what the National is for,'' Mr. Starr said. ''It was built at taxpayers' expense, and we're here for public benefit.'' Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, the largest theater-owning group on Broadway, said such a scheme would not work in New York, where there is nothing comparable to the National, much less to its pricing structure. London, he said, ''is a wholly different culture.'' ''Put it this way,'' Mr. Schoenfeld added. ''I have never seen that kind of commitment, if you will, in New York, where, to begin with, they've been talking about having a national theater in America since -- who knows? -- the days of the Revolution.''", "title": "A Gamble Pays Off for Theatergoing on the Cheap in London"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/New York", "Top/News/U.S./Mid-Atlantic", "Top/Features/Arts", "Top/News/World/Europe", "Top/Features/Theater", "Top/Features/Theater/News and Features", "Top/Features/Theater/News and Features/Companies and Organizations", "Top/Features/Theater/News and Features/Companies and Organizations/Royal National Theater", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Music, Theater and Dance", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe/Britain/England/London", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe/Britain", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe/Britain/England", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/New York/New York City"], "publication_day_of_month": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Arts; Theater", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "print_page_number": "3", "publication_day_of_week": "Monday", "print_section": "E", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/01/theater/01lond.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "01LOND$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Every election season, a debate over a journalistic October surprise takes place. Four years ago, a television station in Portland, Me., reported five days before the presidential election that George W. Bush had been arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol back in 1976. In the California gubernatorial election last year, The Los Angeles Times published the accounts of 16 women who said that they had been sexually mistreated and humiliated by Arnold Schwarzenegger, the first of the articles running five days before the vote. Last Monday, The New York Times and CBS News reported that the Iraqi interim government had warned the United States and international nuclear inspectors that nearly 380 tons of powerful conventional explosives were missing from the Qaqaa munitions facility in Iraq. In the ensuing uproar over the revelations, charges of journalistic impropriety and partisanship fly and many question whether the news media should report something so controversial so close to Election Day. There are no firm rules guiding news organizations through these journalistic minefields. Some journalists have no compunction about printing or broadcasting controversial news about a political candidate in the last weeks of an election campaign. Others apply calculus to their deliberations, trying to determine the equation of topic, distance and fairness. Still others refuse to run any investigative articles in the week, or sometimes in the last two days, before the election. ''On the one hand, you're always weighing what the public needs to know before they vote,'' said Michael R. Beschloss, a presidential historian. ''On the other hand, are you putting a charge out so close to the election that those who are criticize do not have time to respond.'' Last week, after The Times and CBS reported on the missing munitions, the Republican National Committee research department sent an e-mail message to supporters and journalists attacking the report as flawed and charging a partisan bias. ''New York Times and Kerry campaign aren't ones to let facts get in way of good story,'' read one headline. And Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political strategist, said he thought the paper deliberately timed the report in an effort to hurt Mr. Bush's chances in the week before the election. Jim Dyke, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said he did not think that standards at this point in the campaign should be any different than the rest of the year. ''The concern that some people have had, as we approach this election, is that some publications have chosen to shade the facts in a way that leaves the reader with a misimpression or an inaccurate impression, and therefore does a disservice to those who look to those outlets for the facts, and does a disservice to the outlet as well,'' he said. Mr. Dyke declined to cite specific news organizations. Bill Keller, executive editor of The New York Times, said the paper learned from CBS of a memorandum about the high explosives, sent from the Iraqi interim government to the International Atomic Energy Agency, early in the week of Oct. 18, and that its reporters reported through the week. ''The timing is really not much of an issue,'' Mr. Keller said. ''The story was ready to go and was published more than a week before Election Day. There was plenty of time for the candidates on both sides and their partisans to react, for additional information to come out.'' Had the article not been ready until a day or two before the election, Mr. Keller said, the decision to publish would have been more difficult. ''I can't say categorically you should not publish an article damaging to a candidate in the last days before an election,'' he said. ''If you learned a day or two before the election that a candidate had lied about some essential qualification for the job -- his health or criminal record -- and there's no real doubt and you've given the candidate a chance to respond and the response doesn't cast doubt on the story, do you publish it? Yes. Voters certainly have a right to know that.'' But he added, ''If you have it ready to go a week earlier and you hold it till two days before the election, then the ambush question kicks in.'' Jeff Fager, the executive producer of the Sunday edition of ''60 Minutes,'' said had his news program's segment on the missing munitions been ready, he would have broadcast it on Oct. 24, but not during last night's program. (The original plan was to report the development about the same time, but The New York Times was able to complete its article before ''60 Minutes'' finished its version. When the paper published its article on Oct. 25, a short version of the report was broadcast that night on the ''CBS Evening News,'' and a longer ''60 Minutes'' version was never completed.) ''Knowing what we know now about that story, we would not have felt comfortable running it two days before the election,'' Mr. Fager said. ''When you're talking about having 48 hours left, that doesn't seem to be appropriate to break a story that could have a significant impact on the election. There has to be time for each candidate to be able to respond.'' The Los Angeles Times found itself sharply criticized last year when it published the accounts of sexual mistreatment just days before the California gubernatorial election. Mr. Schwarzenegger criticized the report as ''trash politics.'' Representative David Dreier, a California Republican, accused the paper of partisanship. And the paper was inundated with angry letters and e-mail messages. The paper staunchly defended its actions. As John S. Carroll, editor of The Los Angeles Times, wrote in an opinion piece last October, ''Better, I say, to be surprised by your newspaper in October than to learn in November that your newspaper has betrayed you by withholding the truth.'' Dean Baquet, the paper's managing editor, said the experience helped sharpen the thinking of the editors about how to deal with the timing of such sensitive articles. ''It's insulting to the reader to not put in the paper important information,'' he said, adding that ''It's a difficult time in a presidential election when you're in the middle of a war to not publish stories that will spark debate about the incumbent.'' But there are some exceptions, Mr. Baquet said. ''There's a certain kind of marginal kind of story about a candidate in a political race: your edgy piece of enterprise that is not really determined by time; the three-part series that examines a candidate's record in a negative light. You really shouldn't run that in the last days of a campaign.'' Just exactly how one determines the proper distance between article and Election Day is a matter of debate. David Winston, a Republican strategist, said content should play a large part in an article's timing. ''If you are just contrasting one person's position with another, I don't think it's all that critical,'' he said. ''But when it is just purely throwing mud, I think that people are going to treat it very skeptically and it could backfire.'' Richard Lowry, the editor of the conservative magazine The National Review who wrote the Oct. 25 cover article, ''What went wrong'' in Iraq?, said because his magazine published on a biweekly schedule, he did not usually confront the issue, although it could publish on its Web site. ''Still,'' he said, ''you reach a certain red zone, which I would say begins the Friday before the election. Just as hockey referees don't usually call a lot of penalties in the last 10 minutes of the game and in overtime, I think there should be extra checking and extra worry that comes late in the campaign.'' There are absolutists on the matter, on both sides. The editors of two weekly magazines, James Kelly, the managing editor of Time, and David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, said they would publish possibly damaging articles if they were confident in the journalism behind them. ''It is very simple,'' Mr. Kelly said, ''The compact you have with the reader is that we are going to give you relevant information in a timely manner.'' Mr. Kelly added that in 1996, Time published a hard-hitting investigation into fund-raising at the Clinton White House in the issue that came out the day before the election. But Deborah Howell, the Washington bureau chief and editor of Newhouse News Service, said she thought there was a common understanding among most newspapers. ''The old standard that I had growing up in the newspaper business is that you never introduce anything new on the Monday before the election,'' she said. ''And you have to be real careful with anything you do on Sunday as well.'' And Ben Bradlee, the former executive editor of The Post, said that he made it a practice to never publish an investigative article in the week before the election. ''If you have a true bomb to drop and you can't give them enough warning, it probably isn't fair,'' Mr. Bradlee said.", "title": "Media Timing and the October Surprise"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/Business", "Top/News/Business/Media and Advertising", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/United States", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Iraq", "Top/News", "Top/News/Washington", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/Issues/Foreign Policy", "Top/News/World/Middle East", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Government, Philanthropy and NGO", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Middle East", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Middle East/Iraq"], "publication_day_of_month": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Business; Washington", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Business/Financial Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Monday", "print_section": "C", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/01/business/media/01media.html", "print_column": "2", "slug": "01MEDI$05"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Koji Suzuki does not look like a rock star.

But in Tokyo, where he lives with his wife and two daughters, Mr. Suzuki often generates rock-star level adulation when he makes public appearances or even when he ventures into the neighborhood near his apartment overlooking Tokyo Bay. ''I was out recently doing push-ups in the park,'' Mr. Suzuki said, through a translator, smiling, ''and I could hear these people talking, looking at me, saying, 'It's Koji Suzuki!''' This is because over the last decade Mr. Suzuki has written a series of horror novels and short stories that have earned him the title -- one that alternately annoys and flatters him -- of the Stephen King of Japan. He has sold more than 10 million copies of his books in his native country. But much more so than Carrie or Cujo or Christine, Mr. Suzuki's most frightening creation -- Sadako, a demonic, hermaphroditic girl at the center of his 1989 book ''The Ring'' and its sequels -- has pervaded Japanese popular culture, becoming a boogeyman used to scare children and, for adults, a metaphor for everything corrupt, cruel and frightening about modern society. Beginning with the 1998 film adaptation of ''The Ring,'' by the director Hideo Nakata -- which became the highest-earning horror film in Japanese history -- Mr. Suzuki has also become a virtual one-man scary-movie plot machine. He is credited as one of the creators of a new, scarier, psychological horror genre known as J-horror, with less splatter and a lot more dread. The 2002 American remake of ''The Ring,'' starring Naomi Watts, earned almost $130 million in theaters, and ''The Ring Two,'' also starring Ms. Watts, is scheduled for release next year. A short story from Mr. Suzuki's 1996 collection ''Dark Water'' -- which was just translated into English and which he was in New York last week promoting -- is also being made into a movie, starring Jennifer Connelly, to be released next year. And the rights to another story, ''Adrift,'' about a haunted boat, were recently bought by Dimension Films, a division of Miramax. There have been so many adaptations, in film, on television and in comic-book form, of Mr. Suzuki's writing that he sometimes loses track of it all. Lingering over his cup of tea, he explained that the American version of ''Ring Two,'' being produced by DreamWorks, is not a remake of the Japanese version but is basically a creation of its screenwriters, a notion that amuses Mr. Suzuki. ''It's a little like the virus idea of 'The Ring,' itself,'' he said. ''It just keeps getting replicated, and I have no control over it.'' Asked if he minded, he laughed and, in emphatic English, said no. After all, the stories have made Mr. Suzuki a wealthy man. He wrote ''The Ring'' while his wife supported the family working as a high school teacher and he took care of their daughters. In fact, he recently indulged his nautical obsessions by buying a sailing yacht, in addition to another boat he owns. His wife quit teaching long ago, and Mr. Suzuki can afford to travel around the world, sail, practice martial arts and ride motorcycles. (He once rode one from California to Florida.) More important to him, he said, it has given him the time to write more novels in Japan (no English translations yet) that have nothing to do with ghostly girls or deadly videotapes or postmodern creepiness. They are instead the kind of fiction he always wanted to write, after falling under the spell of Sartre, Thomas Mann and especially Camus's ''Stranger.'' In fact, in the mid-1990's, after his horror writing had made him into one of his country's most successful writers, he vowed publicly that he would never write horror again, and he concentrated instead on the straight-ahead fiction, much of which revolved around seafaring. ''I actually don't like all that supernatural stuff,'' he said, adding, ''I really dislike most horror writing.'' He said that from the beginning he hoped his frightening fiction would frighten not because it would tap into Japanese obsessions with the supernatural, but because it revolved around the more realistic and even scarier subjects of technology and scientific knowledge -- or more accurate, the limits of both those things. The ''Spiral,'' a sequel to ''The Ring,'' explained (some readers might say further complicating) many of the creepier aspects of the previous novel by venturing largely into science fiction -- with plot elements concerning DNA and smallpox. Mr. Suzuki said, in fact, that of all the concepts he has considered as a writer, he still finds the number pi one of the most terrifying. He has often thought about the consequences if a powerful enough computer were able to find a pattern in the numbers to the right of the decimal point, a discovery Carl Sagan imagined, with theological implications, in his novel ''Contact.'' Mr. Suzuki's ending would undoubtedly be less comforting. ''That's the sort of thing I find scary,'' he said. ''That's what gives me the chills.'' If there is any constant in his horror writing, he said, it is that -- like any novelist -- he has put the things he loves and knows best into his fiction. But paradoxically, those are the things that often become the most terrifying. As a father of two daughters, for example, he has also written extensively about children and good parenting, but Sadako, his lethal creation, becomes a mistreated little girl, not a traditional horror-film monster or blade-gloved slasher. And many of his books revolve around people who live in cities near the ocean, and the water becomes a source of their deepest fears. (In the prologue to the collection ''Dark Water,'' a character counsels: ''Any particularly intriguing thing you may come across on the beach is best left untouched -- because it begins to tell its tale to you, as soon as you pick it up.'') But Mr. Suzuki loves cities, has lived near the ocean his whole life and is passionate about sailing. He said he really could not explain how these transformations into horror happened, but he did add that he was recently caught in a typhoon on his yacht and was quite scared of the ocean for a few hours himself. To the delight of many of his fans, Mr. Suzuki recently decided to break his vow never to write horror again, and he is now at work on his first scary book in years, which will be set in California and will examine the unexplained disappearances of groups of people. ''As much as I didn't want to be constricted by one genre, I came to realize that by saying I wouldn't write horror again, I was constricting myself in that way, too,'' he said, revealing that the title is ''Edge City'' but adding firmly that he would reveal no more. Sitting across from him, Ioannis Mentzas, the editorial director of Vertical, a small Manhattan company that has published English translations of Mr. Suzuki and other Japanese writers, smiled at his author. ''Apparently, it's going to be all about matter and antimatter and what happens when the two come together,'' he said. ''But that's all he'll tell me now. I can't get anything more out of him.''", "title": "Bringing Out the Horror Of What He Knows Best"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Japan", "Top/Features/Arts", "Top/News/World/Asia Pacific", "Top/Features/Books", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Media, Entertainment and Publishing", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia/Japan"], "publication_day_of_month": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Arts; Books", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Monday", "print_section": "E", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/01/books/01suzu.html", "print_column": "5", "slug": "01SUZU$02"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "As far as eclectic evenings go, a program on Saturday night billed as the gala concert of the weeklong Russian Nights Festival was more scattershot than most. The obvious draw at Alice Tully Hall was Anastasia Volochkova, the ballerina fired from the Bolshoi Ballet in September 2003 after a brouhaha over her weight and since reinstated (albeit demoted). There were also some unexpected moments. The festival's producer, Stas Namin, a grandson of the prominent Bolshevik Anastas Mikoyan, presented Arthur Mitchell, director of the Dance Theater of Harlem, with an arts award that has been given to, among others, Sharon Stone and Ray Bradbury. Mr. Namin also said Russian-American members of the American military who had served in Iraq were in the audience and asked them to rise for applause. Onstage, the mixed program included some of Russia's leading musicians and opera singers, as well as Lori Belilove, the American dancer who specializes in Isadora Duncan's repertory. With its call for revolution, a solo that Duncan had choreographed during her pro-Bolshevik period was not exactly a hit with a largely \u00e9migr\u00e9 audience that had lived under Communism. To those in the know there was something poignant about the pas de deux that Ms. Volochkova and Evgeny Ivanchenko danced from ''The Phantom Ball,'' a 1995 ballet by Dmitri Briantsev. Mr. Briantsev, the 57-year-old director of Moscow's second major ballet company, the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Ballet, has not been seen since he left his hotel in Prague in July. The Czech police are investigating his disappearance. The Russian Nights Festival, a celebration of Russian culture that ended yesterday, went strangely unheralded in New York but included more than worthwhile poetry readings, concerts and presentations of early Soviet films. Saturday's gala was both a classical variety show and a thinly disguised showcase for Ms. Volochkova, who appeared six times on the program. All the other artists, except accompanists and the Kremlin Chamber Orchestra, which opened and closed the evening, performed once. Ms. Volochkova, looking big-boned but svelte, did battle with a floor cloth that was obviously more geared to moving grand pianos in and out than to dancing on toe. She slipped three times but never fell. Americans have seen her to better advantage, beginning with her United States debut in 1995 with the Kirov Ballet from St. Petersburg at the Metropolitan Opera. A few years later she appeared as a guest at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with the Vaganova Academy, the Kirov school, where she was trained. After moving to the Bolshoi in Moscow in 1998, she has been seen at the Kennedy Center in Washington with that company. Obviously, she is not an unknown quantity. She is an excellently trained dancer, a product of the Vaganova school, who could be even better if she were not so careless about her feet, often sloppy. She would benefit from consistent coaching. Just as obviously, she is a headstrong performer and one interested in creativity. This program included contemporary pieces, including ''Angel,'' by a Washington choreographer, Dana Tai Soon. At the Kirov Ballet, Ms. Volochkova faced competition from Ulyana Lopatkina, Diana Vishneva and Svetlana Zakharova (now at the Bolshoi). To say her career was blocked by more talented dancers is too simple. She chose to be a dancer less concerned with classical purity than with expressing her glamorous persona within a classical style. A change in style at the Kirov might have pushed her in that direction. She was one of the young ballerinas in her Kirov generation nicknamed basketball players because they were so tall. Suddenly the emphasis was on ultra-high leg extensions and kicks. These were still very much part of Ms. Volochkova's style on Saturday although they are less encouraged in the Bolshoi. The evening began with a wonderfully vigorous account of Tchaikovsky's ''Souvenir de Florence'' by the Kremlin Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Misha Rakhlevsky. Mr. Namin and his American partner Matthew Rich described the ''Tower Award'' given to Mr. Mitchell as a tribute to arts and letters. It is named after the Constructivist tower envisioned by Vladimir Tatlin in 1920 but never built in the Soviet Union. The avant-garde symbolized by Tatlin was represented in the films and poetry of the festival (another will be held in Los Angeles from April 3 to April 10). But there was hardly a whiff of experiment on this program except in Alexei Arkhipovsky's balalaika solo, full of impressive irony and virtuosity. The classical music on the program, however, was performed with individuality. Ekaterina Mechetina threw her head back dramatically after playing a piano version of ''Largo al factotum'' from ''The Barber of Seville.'' The Bolshoi soprano Makvala Kasrashvili sang arias from ''Tosca'' and ''Cavalleria Rusticana,'' accompanied by Liya Mogilevskaya on the piano. Later, the Kirov Opera soprano Ekaterina Solovieva was also accompanied by Ms. Mogilevskaya in arias from ''Iolanta'' and ''Adriana Lecouvreur.'' Ms. Volochkova's offerings were thin soup. Vladimir Vassiliev's ill-fated ''Swan Lake,'' which he staged when he was director of the Bolshoi in the late 1990's, featured the ballet's Russian dance on toe. In this instance it looked disjointed. A change of pace came with the tenor Andrei Ilyushnikov as the abandoned Chinese prince in Lehar's ''Land of Smiles.'' Ms. Volochkova returned with Mr. Ivanchenko, the Kirov dancer who was usually imported to partner her at the Bolshoi, in a Sovietized version of the tambourine dance from ''Esmeralda.'' Mr. Ivanchenko was always gallant if rarely acknowledged by his partner, who was in fine technical form. Her preparations, however, for pirouettes were too obvious and her fouett\u00e9s had no shape. Ms. Belilove, an excellent Duncan dancer, needed a more welcoming context. Dressed in red, she moved from bondage to liberation with a fist raised in ''Revolutionary Etude.'' The Scriabin music was played on the piano by Matthew Ward. Ms. Volochkova came back with a fine rendition of Michel Fokine's ''Dying Swan,'' stretching her body to the utmost. Musical virtuosity then came to the fore with the violinist Sergei Stadler, accompanied by Yulia Stadler and with Boris Andrianov on the cello. ''Angel,'' Ms. Soon's solo for Ms. Volochkova, to an arrangement of Schubert's ''Ave Maria,'' had the dancer moving in and out of cruciform positions when not swirling in a capelike fabric upon which she came to rest: odd. A brief number by Paul Chalmer to an Edith Piaf recording did Ms. Volochkova no favors with its flexed feet and blandness. It was a relief to see the unity of Mr. Briantsev's neo-Romantic duet to Chopin from ''The Phantom Ball.'' Full of embraces, lifts and rolls on the floor, it was strongly performed by Ms. Volochkova and Mr. Ivanchenko.

And intentionally so. As part of an academic conference on the idea of randomness, the pianist Emanuele Arciuli performed a thoughtful program of works at the Italian Academy Teatro at Columbia University on Friday night. Before the concert, well-appointed theorists of happenstance sipped wine and chatted, while a computer projected random numbers onto a wall and a prerecorded male voice recited an ancient philosophical tract by Lucretius. For the concert, Mr. Arciuli juxtaposed pieces based on improvisation and chance procedures with works based on complex and fixed notational schemes. At the improvisational end of the spectrum was a selection from Karlheinz Stockhausen's ''Aus den Sieben Tagen,'' so-called intuitive music generated by the performer in response to the composer's verbal text alone. In this case, Mr. Stockhausen's words were read aloud: ''Give up everything; we were on the wrong track,'' the text said. ''Begin with yourself: you are a musician.'' The pianist answered with a freewheeling improvisation that scampered over centuries of music's past, pristinely voiced major chords disintegrating into ominous clouds of atonal chaos. At the opposite extreme was John Adams's ''Phrygian Gates,'' a long-form essay in propulsive minimalism, which Mr. Arciuli played with exacting clarity and vigor. Carlo De Incontrera's vividly drawn ''Meeres Stille'' added a flute (played by Margaret Lancaster) and a pre-recorded chorus of cicadas. The natural world made a more abstract appearance in Mr. Stockhausen's Klavierstuck IX, based on the Fibonacci sequence of numbers that also describes patterns common in living things. Short works by Morton Feldman, Talib Rasul Hakim and Alessandro Sbordoni explored concepts of indeterminacy, chance and memory. Mr. Arciuli dispatched this music with impressive technique and seriousness of purpose. A brief program note by the pianist alluded to the music's development. The high point of chance music arrived after World War II, partly as a challenge to the very notion of grand ideologies that was now implicated by the war itself. The style gained momentum in the 1960's era of radicalism and Zen-inspired musical experimentation. It's a fascinating history. But while the music in question may be indeterminate, the length of this review, alas, is not.

Their only moment of glory was the Joe Namath era. And for decades, they have suffered the indignity of having to play in a stadium named after their cross-swamp rivals, the Giants. Now the Jets management, with the support of the city, is threatening to create a new stadium on the far West Side of Manhattan that is so crassly commercial it makes the head spin. It may provide the Jets with a home, but it will extinguish any hope of injecting some humanity into the area. Designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, the 75,000-seat stadium is shaped like an enormous shoe box and would cover the three blocks from 30th to 33rd Streets on a railyard site overlooking the Hudson River. A retractable roof would allow it to function both as an open-air stadium for the Jets and as an extension of the Jacob J. Javits Convention Center just to the north. The project would have around 50,000 square feet of retail space and a waterfront park. Until now much of the opposition to the stadium has centered on who would foot the bill for the project. But even if it were a gift to the city, the result would be depressing. As if to mask its colossal scale, the stadium is dressed up in a blinding assortment of L.E.D. screens, advertising, shops and restaurants: a mind-numbing spectacle that would echo through the surrounding neighborhoods. The park spaces, supposedly conceived as an act of civic generosity, are nothing more than banal front lawns for retail outlets. The result looks like a parody of late capitalist consumerism. Stripped of its excesses, the stadium itself is not all bad. The structure is supported on the north and south sides by a massive steel frame topped by rows of wind turbines that will generate energy for the building. A series of tapered steel trusses spanning its interior evoke the skeletal steel frames of the old waterfront warehouses that once lined the city's piers. The roof slides open to frame a rectangular patch of sky. (The stadium is also designed so that an additional 10,000 seats could be tacked on to the side facing the river if New York wins its bid for the 2012 Olympic Games.) I've seen uglier stadium designs. Even so, the forms are crude when compared with the sloping concrete planes of Eduardo Souto de Moura's recent soccer stadium in Braga, Portugal, which fold like an origami sculpture to frame views of a valley, or with the soaring tubular arches of Santiago Calatrava's Olympic Stadium in Athens. Kohn Pedersen Fox tries to cloak the deficiencies behind a veil of high-tech graphics. A narrow band of L.E.D. screens projecting scores and advertising messages would run along the stadium's intermediate level, just in front of the corporate boxes. The four corners of the main concourse level, conceived as ''sponsors' rooms,'' are to be emblazoned with corporate logos and colors. On the exterior, a series of programmable screens would flash images across the surrounding neighborhood. The largest, a 55,000-square-foot low-resolution L.E.D. screen, would loom over 11th Avenue, projecting soft-focus images of Jets games or convention events. An arrangement of narrower horizontal screens would create a more abstract pattern of moving images across the north and south facades. On game days, beams of colored light would shoot up into the sky from the top of the turbines. The visual noise would be overwhelming. But what's more unnerving is that some are promoting the stadium design as a model for thoughtful urban development. The proposal is the keystone of a vast development area extending several blocks from Madison Square Garden to the river, with another swath between 10th and 11th Avenues stretching north to 42nd Street. It includes an expanded Pennsylvania Station at the neo-Classical James A. Farley post office building to the east, a corridor of office blocks along 11th Avenue and a smattering of park spaces. To connect the stadium to that context, the architects have proposed a blocklong park flanking the stadium's north side. The park was conceived as a public promenade, linking 11th Avenue to the river. Yet most of the space for it is swallowed up by a proposed one-story retail complex enclosed by an undulating glass wall at the stadium's base. The complex will house shops, a sports museum and an undetermined cultural venue that was no doubt added to help sell the project to the public. It's a generic urban mall for West Siders, tourists and football fans that would efface the neighborhood's gritty but powerful mix of railyards and industrial buildings. It sends a message that the desires of developers once again trump public welfare. Worse still is a plan to connect the stadium to the High Line, a 20-block-long strip of abandoned elevated freight tracks that extends south from the stadium site through Chelsea to the meat-packing district. The nonprofit group Friends of the High Line wants to transform the tracks into an elevated public garden that would thread its way through the streetscape and link a number of West Side neighborhoods. But under Kohn Pedersen Fox's design, this park would plug directly into the stadium, serving as an entry point for football games and convention events. An additional pedestrian walkway would connect the stadium to the new Pennsylvania Station in the Farley building. The contrast between the High Line and the stadium projects could not be more stark. Designed by Field Operations and Diller, Scofidio & Renfro, the High Line plan is conceived as a string of discrete urban moments, ranging from contemplative gardens to an outdoor theater and distant views of the river. The idea is to savor the nuances of everyday urban life, to heighten the contrast between vast scale and intimate spaces that give the city texture. The stadium plan, by comparison, would transform the High Line into a mundane people-moving machine -- a conveyor belt funneling visitors between Pennsylvania Station, the stadium-retail complex and the meat-packing district's bars. It mistakenly assumes that all urban density is good, regardless of its quality. It is a blunt expression of what was once innocently called the culture of consumption. There is nothing new about this strategy. It is rooted in the tired New Urbanist formulas that sprang up in reaction to the Brutalist aesthetic of 1960's and 70's architecture. But at least those modernist visions were imbued with a spirit of social optimism, even when they failed. The stadium plan will enrich developers, while adding nothing of value to the public realm. If this is our vision of humane urban planning, we should fear for the future.

That seems to have been his approach all along: 25 years ago, he seemed focused on Bach, and concentrations on Mozart, Bartok and Schubert followed. Lately he has been interested in Janacek, although not for the first time. He recorded the composer's music for Decca in the early 1990's, and for ECM more recently. In the last couple of weeks, he played in two Janacek-centered chamber concerts at Zankel Hall (although in one, his own performance was in a Dvorak work), and at his recital he offered Janacek's three most substantial piano works, ''On the Overgrown Path'' (Series I), the Sonata ''1.X.1905,'' and ''In the Mists.'' Mr. Schiff finds a universe in these three scores. The tuneful, folk-tinged portraits embody both recollections of the rural Moravia of Janacek's youth and sorrow over the death of the composer's daughter in 1903. Those may not seem to be extremes. Nostalgia, after all, often has a melancholy tinge. Mr. Schiff navigated these currents deftly, and his success at keeping the distinctions clear paid off in his poignant reading of the final vignette, ''The Barn Owl Has Flown Away,'' where nostalgia and grief intermingle. The sonata, which commemorates a riot in Brno in which a student demonstrator was killed, and ''In the Mists,'' an introspective, often brooding work, are denser, more sharp-edged scores. Mr. Schiff's accounts of both thrived on clarity of texture and a fine balance of the dramatic and the emotional, and in the Sonata especially his fluid tempos put the music's passions in high relief. The program also included Smetana's ''Trois Polkas Po\u00e9tiques'' (Op. 8), a set of Chopinesque polka settings that, though charming, don't cry out for further exploration. Mr. Schiff closed the performance with a sparkling, regal account of Chopin's Sonata No. 3 in B minor (Op. 58), marred only by the eerie electronic whistle of a hearing aid during the Largo.

Don't be misled by the title: the show has nothing to do with Dostoevsky's ''Possessed'' or with Witold Gombrowicz's ''Possessed,'' both of which often appear in the theater. (A retelling of Gombrowicz's tale opens next week at the Ohio Theater in SoHo, with the Pig Iron Theater troupe's ''Hell Meets Henry Halfway.'') ''The Unpossessed'' is a theater tribute to Cervantes's ''Don Quixote,'' which itself was conceived 400 years ago as a collection of skits lampooning the popular chivalric ballads of that era. Ms. Klein creates indelible images. As the play opens, two actors, doubling as props, tower 15 feet above the stage, standing atop rolling ladders whose metal rungs are hidden beneath billowing skirts. The actors slowly wheel their extended arms, which hold long flags. The eye gradually makes sense of the scene: they are human windmills. On the floor between them lies a pile of books representing the heap of romances that fed Don Quixote's delirium. Sancho Panza (Matthew Glassman) hovers above the books, clinging to a sash hanging from the ceiling. As a voice cries out, ''Sancho!,'' a hand rises from the books, startling the audience. The hand is followed by the Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance himself (Carlos Uriona), who emerges, grey-bearded, demented and inspired, scattering the fictions. The spell cast by this opening scene lasts throughout the hour that follows. Signal episodes from Cervantes's epic are recreated by six performers, who change personas, walk on stilts, swing above the audience on silken sashes, stage a shadow puppet play and roll across the stage in cow troughs (a circular metal frame that is filled with hay on farms, used here to heighten the vertiginous mood). The mayhem is accompanied by a haunting score, performed by the actors, who play the mandolin, guitar, violin, cello and accordion. Richard Newman, in a number of roles (he is also one of the windmills) displays striking energy. If there is a familiar image that might help to understand the effect of this visual poetry, it is the scene in Fellini's ''Strada'' in which Gelsomina, wandering the streets of a grubby village, stands transfixed, watching a man in wings walk above the crowd on a tightrope, without a net. But Ms. Klein doesn't count Fellini among her influences; she is a disciple of the Polish director Jerzy Grotowski, and means to blend his unreined trope-hopping with the acrobatic spectacle of South American street theater. Poetic, bathetic, punning and perverse, her show is a rough jumble of wonderment. Cervantes's goal with ''Don Quixote'' was to mock idealism for its futility, while at the same time creating a monument to it; that is also the goal of this production. ''The Unpossessed'' is at La MaMa Annex, 74A East Fourth Street in the East Village, through Nov. 7.

Total estimates for sales are higher than they have been since May 1990, the last big auction season before the art market crashed six months later. Some works come from estates, others from well-known collectors who saw the high prices at last spring's sales and are betting the market's upward spiral will continue. Competition between Sotheby's and Christie's has been so fierce this season that the matter of which company gets the business often comes down to the art of the deal: how big a guarantee -- an undisclosed minimum sum promised to the seller regardless of the outcome of bidding -- an auction house is willing to give. Sometimes the house puts up all the money itself; other times, to spread the risk, it silently works with a dealer or a collector willing to invest in a collection or a work of art. The result often means higher prices but lower returns. When a work is guaranteed, the profits are shared by the auction house, the seller and any investor. In addition, experts frequently end up putting higher estimates on works that have been guaranteed to cover their costs. It's a risky business. This season, the number of guarantees makes these risks as high as the quality of the art. ''There's an enormous amount of money being made, and the number of people wanting to put their savings on their walls is larger than it's ever been,'' said Tobias Meyer, director of contemporary art for Sotheby's worldwide and the company's principal auctioneer. ''This is not about spending $500,000. These people are not afraid to spend several million dollars for something they know is really good.'' Each auction season reflects current tastes and fashions. For several years there has been a shift away from older, Impressionist works and toward a more modern sensibility. Sotheby's sale on Thursday night is heavily tipped toward more modern art; paintings by Kandinsky, Mondrian and Modigliani are among the top lots. Christie's auction on Wednesday has its share of pretty, classic Impressionist paintings. The work with the highest estimate at Christie's is Monet's ''Houses of Parliament,'' being sold by the heirs of Monet's dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel. The dreamy scene of the buildings glimpsed through thick fog, painted in 1904, is expected to sell for $12 million to $18 million. ''There have been relatively few Impressionist works on the market recently,'' said Nicholas Maclean, Christie's international director of Impressionist and modern art. ''Based on the interest we are seeing, we are confident all the top Impressionist works will sell well.''Christie's sale of 58 lots this week is expected to bring $112 million to $158 million, far less than the $208 million to $290 million expected for Sotheby's 61 lots. But one collection at Christie's -- paintings, drawings and sculptures collected over the last 60 years by Nathan L. Halpern, a television impresario who died in April -- is especially interesting. Experts say the most sought-after work will be a rare Mir\u00f3, ''Caress of the Stars'' (1938), which is expected to sell for $6 million to $8 million. The painting, with the artist's well-known abstractly grotesque figures juxtaposed against a galaxy of stars, is Mir\u00f3's visual comment on the horrors of the Spanish Civil War and hope for the future of the Spanish Republic. Sotheby's sale the next night has four paintings expected to fetch more than $20 million each. Of the group, the one that experts say will be the big question of the evening is a Tahitian-period Gauguin, estimated at $40 million to $50 million. ''Maternit\u00e9 (II),'' from 1899, was painted about the time the artist's 17-year-old Polynesian mistress, Pahura, gave birth to their son. It is said to have some condition problems and has been restored several times; dealers and auction house experts say it was quietly offered for sale this summer. But David Norman, a co-chairman of Impressionist and modern art department for Sotheby's worldwide, stands by the painting. ''There have been some restorations, but relative to Gauguins of the period it's in good condition,'' he said, adding that its rarity makes its appearance at auction particularly noteworthy. ''This is one of the last major works of the Tahitian period left in private hands,'' he said. Little speculation surrounds a Modigliani being sold by Dorothy Cherry, the widow of Wendell Cherry, chairman of the Louisville-based health care company Humana, who died in 1991. ''Jeanne H\u00e9buterne (in Front of a Door),'' from 1919, is one of the last portraits of the artist's lover and muse, who was 22 and pregnant with their second child when she leaped to her death the day after the artist died of tuberculosis. It is expected to sell for $20 million to $30 million, but experts in the field think the price could go far higher. The biggest growth is evident in art made since 1945. ''There are new buyers every season,'' said Amy Cappellazzo, a co-head of Christie's postwar and contemporary art department. ''Buyers are in their 30's and 40's and have made a lot of money in financial markets.'' Price barriers will be broken this season, Ms. Cappellazzo said. On Nov. 10 Christie's has a group of works designated only as ''property from an important American collection.'' Experts in the field say it was formed over 40 years by Dr. Paul and Dorie Sternberg, Chicago philanthropists. Included in the collection is one of Jasper Johns's classic cross-hatch paintings. Executed in 1981-82, the untitled work in deep reds, blues and greens features a skull, one of the artist's leitmotifs, on the right of the canvas. Christie's estimates it will sell for $3.5 million to $4.5 million. Sotheby's sale on Nov. 11 also features work by Mr. Johns. The Hollywood entertainment executive David Geffen is selling ''0 Through 9,'' a charcoal drawing executed in 1961. The image of superimposed, stenciled numbers is considered one of the artist's seminal works and is estimated to sell for $7 million to $9 million. Buyers looking for works by younger, less expensive artists may want to go to Phillips, de Pury & Company in Chelsea. The small boutique company is holding two sales this season, next Monday and Nov. 12. Of the two, the more interesting is what experts say is the first single-owner sale of contemporary photography. Baroness Marion Lambert, wife of Baron Philippe Lambert, a member of the Belgian banking family, is selling her entire collection of 300 photographs by artists including Matthew Barney, Richard Prince, Robert Gober and Nan Goldin. The collection, which is expected to bring $10 million, is well known to photography collectors and has been exhibited around the world for years.", "title": "High Quality, High Stakes At Fall Art Auctions"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/Features/Arts", "Top/Features/Arts/Art and Design", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Activities and Interests/Art", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Art and Design"], "publication_day_of_month": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Arts", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Monday", "print_section": "E", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/01/arts/design/01auct.html", "print_column": "5", "slug": "01AUCT$07"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "The American team seemed headed for a rare victory over an old rival at the World Team Olympiad here Sunday, but their opponents, the Italian world champions, stormed back to snatch a victory. The Americans began the day trailing by three imps, and had built up a 30-imp lead with 14 deals remaining. But in the next 11 the Italians bid and played brilliantly, guessing well into the bargain. The Americans fought hard, but were not at their best. With three deals remaining the Italians led by 22, and held on to win by 12 in spite of an American gain on a slam deal. The Italians in action were Norberto Bocchi, Giorgio Duboin, Fulvio Fantoni and Claudio Nunes, with Alfredo Versace and Lorenzo Lauria resting. Michael Rosenberg, Zia Mahmood, Bobby Levin and Steve Weinstein were at the table, with Roy Welland and Bjorn Fallenius on the bench. Another strong finish was produced by Hungary, who gained 35 in the last set of 16 deals to defeat France by 14. Russia clung to a small lead and beat Turkey by 7. Japan had a small lead against Egypt, and prevailed by 24. The other matches were not close. China overwhelmed Iceland, winning by 114. Netherlands beat Germany by 33. Ireland beat Sweden, also by 33. And Pakistan defeated England by 37. In quarterfinal play Sunday night, the pairings are: Italy v. Pakistan; China v. Japan; Hungary v. Russia; Netherlands v. Ireland. The United States, represented Leo Bell, Neil Chambers, Marshall Miles, John Onstott, Jim Robison and John Schermer, won the Senior Teams title. The Netherlands and Germany placed second and third. The United States Women's team made a good start in the round of 16, leading Turkey by 50. In other matches the scores were: China led South Africa by 89; Croatia led Sweden by 3; Poland led Austria by 13; Finland led Netherlands by 20; Germany led Russia by 32; France led Greece by 27; and England led Italy by 31. The United States Open Team has performed well here, the loss to Italy notwithstanding, with good prospects in this week's playoffs. On the diagramed deal Rosenberg offered some of the magic that causes many to rate him the world's best cardplayer. At the other table in a match on Wednesday, a Norwegian contract of three clubs was defeated by an American lead of the diamond ten by East. Rosenberg landed in an abnormal and precarious contract of two hearts as shown. West might have raised his partner to two spades, which would have succeeded unless South was inspired to lead the heart ace and give his partner a ruff. The declarer received considerable help when West led the diamond ace, but the contract was still likely to fail. The diamond queen was continued and taken by the king. After long thought, Rosenberg made the unexpected play of the heart three. The defense would have been in control if West had put up the king or queen, but that would have been abnormal, since East might have had an honor. The nine won in dummy, and a club finesse would have been effective. But a low spade was led from dummy to the queen. South now had an accurate picture of the opposing cards. He played the ace of hearts followed by the jack, losing to the queen. West cashed his diamond jack and made an obvious play that proved fatal: he tabled the heart king. That left this position: When West led a diamond, dummy gave up a club and South ruffed. But East had been caught in a position known as a nonmaterial squeeze. He had to discard a spade, an apparently unimportant card. When South led the spade jack, East was helpless. If he won and led a spade, the declarer would be able to take a club finesse. And if East held up his spade ace, he would be endplayed in that suit and forced to lead a club at the 12th trick. The United States gained an unexpected 5 imps en route to winning by 20-10 victory points.

He was 62. The cause was diabetes-related complications, according to a spokeswoman for Avery Laboratories, the company based in Commack, N.Y., that Dr. Dobelle acquired in 1983. Dr. Dobelle led one of several teams of scientists around the world seeking to develop technology for artificial vision. He received widespread publicity four years ago after his system restored limited navigational abilities to a volunteer who was blind. The system, which remains experimental, uses a tiny camera mounted in glasses worn by the blind person. The camera images are relayed to a portable computer and transmitted to surgically implanted electrodes attached to the brain's visual cortex. Dr. Eli Friedman, a nephrologist and professor at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn and a longtime friend of Dr. Dobelle, said in an e-mail message, ''He tenaciously held on to the concept that an external sensor creating a digital image could convey a signal to the brain that would be interpreted as usable sight.'' Dr. Dobelle was born in Pittsfield, Mass., and showed an early talent for invention. He applied for his first patent at 13 for artificial hip improvements that he developed with his father, Martin, an orthopedic surgeon. He entered Vanderbilt University at 14 and, in 1956, he built an X-ray machine. In an interview with Wired magazine two years ago, Dr. Dobelle recalled his early attraction to the field that became his life's work. ''I've always done artificial organs,'' he said. ''I've spent my whole life in the spare-parts business. I just inherited it from my father. By age 8, I was doing real research.'' He completed his undergraduate education at Johns Hopkins University, where he also earned a master's in biophysics. Later, he received his Ph.D. in physiology from the University of Utah and was director of the division of artificial organs at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Dr. Dobelle conducted much of the work on his artificial vision system in Europe at the Dobelle Institute, a center he founded in the 1980's that is now based in Lisbon. He is survived by his wife, Claire; a son, Martin; and two daughters, Molly and Mimi, all of Muttontown, N.Y.; and his brother, Evan, of Honolulu.", "title": "Dr. William Dobelle, Artificial Vision Pioneer, Dies at 62"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/U.S.", "Top/News/Obituaries"], "publication_day_of_month": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "U.S.; Obituaries", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "National Desk", "print_page_number": "23", "publication_day_of_week": "Monday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/01/obituaries/01dobelle.html", "print_column": "3", "slug": "01DOBE$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "The lawyer for a United Nations staff member who brought sexual harassment charges against Ruud Lubbers, the high commissioner for refugees, said Friday that Secretary General Kofi Annan's admission that he had overruled his own investigators in clearing Mr. Lubbers would support an appeal against the ruling. ''It just confirms what we knew to be true,'' said Edward Patrick Flaherty, the Geneva-based lawyer representing the woman, who is identified only as a 51-year-old American with 20 years of service and who is now a senior administrator in the refugee office. ''The complaints were sustained by the Office of Internal Oversight Services, and Mr. Annan's decision in July was wrong,'' Mr. Flaherty said. That contention, he said, was the basis of an appeal filed Oct. 18 with the Geneva Joint Appeals Board, which must make a recommendation to the secretary general. Mr. Flaherty said his client had also requested that Mr. Lubbers's diplomatic immunity be lifted to allow her to file a lawsuit against him in American, Dutch or Swiss courts. Mr. Lubbers, 65, a former prime minister of the Netherlands, became high commissioner for refugees in 2000. His term concludes at the end of 2005. The admission that Mr. Annan decided to take no action despite the fact that United Nations investigators had found the woman's complaint valid and had recommended punishment emerged last week in the annual report of the oversight office. A senior United Nations official had said earlier that if the claims against Mr. Lubbers were found to be true, he would be obliged to resign. The sensitivity of the matter was underscored by a last-minute restoration to the report of the disclosure. The original, which circulated Wednesday, said only that investigators had ''submitted a report to the secretary general on the allegations.'' A revised version issued on Thursday said the office had ''submitted a report to the secretary general supporting the allegations and recommended that appropriate actions be taken.'' When he cleared Mr. Lubbers of the formal charges of sexual harassment in July, Mr. Annan told the 6,000 staff members of the Geneva-based refugee agency in an open letter that he had sent Mr. Lubbers a tough message admonishing him for his behavior. But he did not reveal the investigators' findings. At the time, Mr. Annan said that the complaint against Mr. Lubbers ''could not be sustained,'' and Fred Eckhard, Mr. Annan's spokesman, said Thursday that the reference was to whether or not there was legal justification for punishment. ''He did not say there was no evidence,'' Mr. Eckhard said. ''He said he found the charges unsustainable on a legal basis.'' Mr. Flaherty argued that the document strengthened his client's case that Mr. Annan ignored internal United Nations investigators' recommendations and decided wrongly to keep Mr. Lubbers in his post. ''This demonstrates that there are two sets of rules in the U.N.,'' Mr. Flaherty said, ''one for the protected class and one for the rest. Mr. Lubbers is part of the protected class. My client is not.'' Associates of the woman said the original complaint, filed May 5, alleged that Mr. Lubbers ''grabbed her behind'' as she left a staff meeting in his office Last December.", "title": "Annan's Comment on U.N.

A visitor must march past Country Casuals, Boots pharmacy, Next, and Marks & Spencer, and pass Accessorize, HMV, Whittard and of course, the dueling coffee shops, Starbucks and Costa Coffee. If it were not for Shakespeare's dwelling and a few notable old houses, this town -- with row upon row of British chain stores -- would scarcely be different from any other in Britain these days. Most butcher shops and hardware stores have closed. So have the family clothing shops, the fishmongers and a long list of other independent businesses. ''If someone blindfolded you, put you in a helicopter and set you down in a town somewhere in England, you wouldn't be able to tell where you are anymore,'' said Jim Hyslop, 55, who lives just outside Stratford. The chain stores, he said, ''change the character of a place.'' In the past five years, chain stores owned by corporations and out-of-town megastores similar to Wal-Mart (one of them, Asda, is, in fact, owned by Wal-Mart), have come to dominate many British towns and cities, creating a palpable sense of homogeneity from Kent all the way to Cumbria, and drawing striking parallels to America. Many of the main shopping thoroughfares, so-called ''high streets,'' now traffic in sameness: ubiquitous cellphone shops (Orange, Vodafone, O2); the familiar coffee chains (Starbucks, Caffe Nero and Costa Coffee); the typical clothing stores (Gap, Next, Warehouse); and the cookie-cutter restaurants (Caf\u00e9 Rouge, ASK, Pizza Express). Neighborhood greengrocers are also on the way out, replaced by chain minisupermarkets, most notably Tesco, a company that has become one of the world's top retailers. ''In the case of Britain, and especially England, there is a huge sense of identity investment in the image of towns and cities, and the notion that this sort of bland, gradual effacement of character is taking place has taxed people at a deep level,'' said Andrew Simms, policy director for the New Economic Foundation, an independent economic research organization that published a report in August called ''Clone Town Britain.'' ''It makes life boring,'' Mr. Simms added. ''It makes our communities boring places to be. That is one thing that has touched people deeply. People don't want to live in towns that look all the same. It's dull.'' In its report, the foundation visited a series of towns and cities and counted both chain shops and independent businesses. It also contends that the spread of chains and sprawling Tesco-style stores winds up hurting local economies, because less money is pumped back into the area, and people are deprived of choice. A previous report in 2002 found that specialty stores like butchers and bakers were closing at a rate of 50 a week, along with 20 traditional pubs a month. The reasons independent businesses are vanishing here are familiar to Americans: high rents; customer demand for cheaper goods; and corporate muscle. It is just that in the past few years their disappearance has become increasingly visible and particularly striking in a part of the world that once took such pride in its community shops. ''It's happening because of the consumer,'' said Nick Gladding, senior analyst at Verdict Research, a group that specializes in retail. ''They are becoming more demanding. ''And people increasingly like familiarity,'' he added, noting that there are generational differences in shopping trends. ''People like to know what to expect when they go into a shop or restaurant.'' Lacey's, an ironmonger, or hardware store, in Stratford-upon-Avon, has been in town for generations. It is run by David Haywaid, 53, as it was by his father and grandfather before him. Mr. Haywaid said the town had changed markedly in recent years as independents had been driven to close because of high rents. ''The only shops that can make money are the clothing shops, with their horrendous markups,'' he said. His own shop is so old-fashioned that it is now a draw in itself, luring nostalgic out-of-towners who pine for ''something different,'' said Mr. Haywaid, who owns the building his store occupies. Around the corner, at Barry the Butcher, Stewart Ashfield, the deputy manager, agrees. Not too long ago, there were 12 butcher shops in town; now there are 2. ''Stratford has changed out of all recognition,'' he said. ''We've been damaged by these chains, and the out-of-town shopping stores where people shop for everything under one roof as in America. What's been lost is the personal touch.'' ''Clone towns,'' though, as the report calls them, are beginning to encounter resistance as people question whether Britain should emulate America or follow Continental Europe, which is trying hard to preserve its uniqueness. In France and Poland, for example, local authorities can veto the construction of large supermarkets. Local governments here are starting to push for economic incentives to guarantee a greater variety of shops. One town, Ludlow, has joined an Italian movement called Citta-slow, which embraces the ''slow town'' concept and promotes the benefits of eating locally grown produce. A few powerful landlords have also taken stands against chain stores. The Mercers' Company, one of London's biggest landlords, is trying to attract independent shops by offering them discounts on the streets around Covent Garden, a popular tourist spot. Howard de Walden Estates, the hereditary landlord of much of Marylebone Village in London, has rejected a number of chains on its high street in order to preserve a unique, and quite popular, mix of shops. The company's chief executive has been critical of local governments, saying they are taking a short-term view of planning by always going with the highest bidder. The question is: Is it too late to stem the tide? ''They talk about a tipping point, where you suddenly see independent retailers wiped out in certain areas,'' said David Bishop, a spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses. ''Unless you take some constructive action now it will resemble the U.S. We're a long way from that, but it is a real danger.''

They swarmed into victory lane with smiles and tears and hugs after Jimmie Johnson's come-from-behind victory. For the first time in a week, they seemed to exhale, relieved to be through the early part of their ordeal. A plane crash last Sunday killed 10 people, including the brother and son of their car owner, Rick Hendrick, as they flew to a race in Martinsville, Va. In front of 104,000 fans at Atlanta Motor Speedway, Hendrick's people, four Nextel Cup drivers and their crews, wrapped their arms around one another in joy. Johnson, the Hendrick team's 29-year-old rising star, found a way to win the Bass Pro Shops MBNA 500 after being dominated by Mark Martin, who led 227 of the 325 laps. Early in the race, when Martin seemed unbeatable, Johnson admonished his crew over his in-car radio, saying, ''It's not over yet,'' when he was told Martin looked too strong. Pressed to the wall, three cars wide on Lap 317, Johnson took the lead and held off Martin by about five car lengths for his third consecutive victory. ''I had 10 angels riding on this race car,'' said Johnson, who led only 17 laps. ''I feel bad for Mark -- he had the dominant car -- but things happen for a reason.'' Johnson was in his car in victory lane when he took a telephone call from Rick Hendrick, who stayed in North Carolina to grieve for his family. ''He just told me, put my hat on backwards for little Ricky,'' Johnson said, referring to 24-year-old Rick Hendrick, who died in the crash and who would wear his hat backward around the team headquarters. A number of things came together to make it a spectacular day for Hendrick Motorsports. Kurt Busch, who led the Nextel Cup standing coming into the race, went only 51 laps of the 325-lap race before blowing his engine. He finished 42nd. And Dale Earnhardt Jr. was running in the top five when he blundered with an aggressive move on Lap 311 of the 325-lap race and crashed. Earnhardt finished 33rd when a fourth-place finish would have put him within 2 points of Busch for the series lead. Busch's and Earnhardt's trouble meant that Johnson was able to move up to second in the standing, 59 points behind the leader Busch with three races to go. Jeff Gordon, Johnson's teammate, had his own engine trouble on Sunday and finished 34th. But Gordon, who was in second place, 96 points behind Busch, before the race, actually gained ground. He is in third place, 72 points off the lead. Three weeks ago, Johnson thought he was out of the championship hunt. He was in ninth place and struggling with back-to-back finishes of 37th and 32nd, but he has rallied with three consecutive victories. Busch, meanwhile, had dodged back luck through the first seven races of the Chase, the 10-race sprint to the finish to close the Nextel Cup season. He said he had a suspicion before Sunday's race that he was due for calamity, and it came when smoke billowed out from under his hood followed by a trail of oil on Turn 3 of Lap 52. ''We did everything we could today to alleviate this type of problem,'' Busch said. ''We ran a conservative gear and had high air pressures. We didn't need a catastrophic failure.'' While Busch was not to blame for his misfortune, Earnhardt caused his own trouble. He moved up the track and cut off Carl Edwards, whose front end clipped the back of Earnhardt's car on the back straightaway, sending the red car spinning into a crash. ''It was kind of disappointing to lose all those points, but I don't think it was Carl's fault there,'' Earnhardt said. ''I just came up on him.'' It seemed to be a day for no hard feelings, even for Martin, who first wondered if a late caution flag that hurt his chances was put out to force an exciting and crowded restart. But Martin decided not to belabor the issue and said, ''We got beat.'' Even the passionate Nascar fans got into the mood of the day. As he drove around the track on his victory lap, Johnson noticed fans of his competitors cheering him when they would have normally been booing. ''This is some kind of medication in a weird way and will only help the healing process,'' Johnson said. ''Today, it didn't matter if you were a fan of the 8, the 20, or the 12. People respected what was done today, and it put a smile on the families involved.''

The fighting flared Friday and continued into the weekend after a Hui taxi driver's car hit and killed a 6-year-old Han girl, prompting recriminations between different ethnic groups in neighboring villages, the journalists and witnesses said. One individual briefed on the incident by the police said 148 people had been killed, including 18 police officers sent to quell the violence. The Chinese news media have reported nothing about unrest in Henan. But a news blackout would not be unusual, because propaganda authorities routinely suppress information about ethnic tensions. Though most Chinese belong to the dominant Han ethnicity, the country has 55 other ethnic groups, including several Muslim minorities and others with ties to Tibet, Southeast Asia, Korea and Mongolia. Hui Muslims, scattered in several provinces in the central and western parts of the country, are relatively well integrated into Chinese society and not generally considered a threat to stability. But outbreaks of Hui unrest were not uncommon in the 1980's, and tensions can bubble to the surface after even minor provocations. Many Hui areas remain impoverished despite rapid economic growth in China's urban and coastal regions, and some members of minority groups say the Han-dominated government does little to steer prosperity to them. The road accident on Friday set off large-scale fighting after relatives, friends and fellow villagers of the girl who was killed, most of them Han, traveled to the mostly Hui village of the taxi driver to demand compensation. The rival villagers failed to settle their dispute, which quickly grew to involve thousands of people in Zhongmou County between the cities of Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, according to two accounts of the incident. The local police failed to contain the unrest and authorities deployed the paramilitary People's Armed Police to restore order. Martial law was declared over the weekend, people in the area said, adding that the situation had since stabilized. One person briefed on the clashes said the authorities might have been particularly alarmed after the police stopped a 17-truck convoy carrying Hui men to the area from other counties and provinces as it passed through Qi County, near Zhongmou. Blockades were set up on major roads in the area, and some bus service was halted. That suggests that word of the violence may have spread through a network of Hui and perhaps other Muslim groups and that mutual support among them is relatively strong. But details were sketchy and difficult to confirm. A police officer who answered the telephone in the Zhongmou County public security office on Sunday night declined to provide any information on the matter. China's countryside and second-tier cities are rife with unrest among peasants and workers complaining about corruption, unpaid wages and other issues. Violent protests, once extremely rare, occur frequently. Last week, rioters set fire to police cars and looted government offices in Wanzhou, in Chongqing municipality in southwest China, after an argument between several people set off a riot involving as many as 10,000 people, residents and Western news agencies reported.", "title": "Martial Law Declared as Nearly 150 Die in Clashes in Central China"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/China", "Top/News/World", "Top/News/World/Asia Pacific", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia/China"], "publication_day_of_month": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "World", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Foreign Desk", "print_page_number": "9", "publication_day_of_week": "Monday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/01/international/asia/01china.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "01CHIN$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Channel 5, this country's only television network not controlled by the government or President Leonid D. Kuchma's allies, had its license to broadcast here in the capital suspended two weeks ago. A day later, a court froze its bank accounts in a legal dispute that turned on whether a leading challenger in the presidential election on Sunday had been poisoned. As voters cast ballots, a weekold hunger strike by a handful of employees was shown at the top of each hour's news, which the channel continues to broadcast in spite of what its director, Vladyslav Lyasovsky, called the government's ''political terrorism.'' ''This sword of Damocles is still hanging over us,'' he said. The government's legal challenges to Channel 5, which remain unresolved, are part of what Mr. Kuchma's opponents, along with international election observers, have called a pattern of harassment and electoral irregularities that calls into question the fairness of the vote to elect Mr. Kuchma's successor. By the time polls closed Sunday at 8 p.m., there was no letup in the accusations that had swirled around the campaign from the start. Officials for the top 2 candidates in the field of 24 -- Mr. Kuchma's choice, Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich, and Viktor A. Yushchenko, a former prime minister and central bank chairman -- denounced what they said were flagrant violations at polling stations across Ukraine. They cited numerous reports of harassment -- and in at least one case a violent assault -- against voters and election observers from both camps. Vadym S. Galaychuk, a manager of Mr. Yushchenko's campaign, said thousands of names had mysteriously vanished from voting lists. He said in some areas as many as 30 percent of voters could not cast ballots. Many were told to appeal to courts, which remained open into the night, though in at least one case in Kiev, Mr. Galaychuk said, a court had closed by 5 p.m. ''We expected this problem,'' he said in an interview, ''but this is on a far more serious scale.'' Initial vote counts released early Monday showed substantially different results. The Central Elections Commission said that with 15 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Yanukovich had 50 percent of the vote and Mr. Yushchenko had 32 percent. But Mr. Yushchenko, appearing at his campaign headquarters, said his campaign's own count showed that he had 50 percent and that Mr. Yanukovich had 27 percent. If neither candidate gets more than 50 percent they will face each other in a runoff, scheduled for Nov. 21. Mr. Yushchenko stopped short of claiming victory, but early Monday he told cheering supporters, perhaps prematurely, ''The democratic forces have won in Ukraine.'' The country's presidential campaign is a watershed in the country's history, and has already been marred by charges of government abuses, accusations of interference from Russia, Europe and the United States, and a controversy surrounding Mr. Yushchenko's mysterious illness, which he attributed to an attempted assassination by poisoning. Mr. Kuchma's decision to step down after two five-year terms has opened a fierce fight over the country's future, with Mr. Yanukovich promising to follow Mr. Kuchma's course and Mr. Yushchenko promising to steer the country toward a more open and democratic path, more closely allied with Europe. ''I want to live in a proper country where people respect honest leaders and do not fear them,'' Mr. Yushchenko, still showing the effects of his illness, said after voting in downtown Kiev. Voting unfolded with a visibly heightened presence of police and military forces in the capital and elsewhere. On Oct. 23, tens of thousands of Mr. Yushchenko's supporters demonstrated outside the elections commission in a rally that ended with violence. The headquarters of both the election commission and the state's main television channel were surrounded Sunday by barricades and military vehicles. ''This step is quite unusual for a country with some democratic traditions,'' said Stepan B. Gavrish, a member of Parliament and a manager of Mr. Yanukovich's campaign. Voter turnout appeared high, as were tensions, though there were no reports of serious disruptions or large demonstrations. Mr. Yushchenko's campaign asked supporters to delay any demonstrations until Monday, when a large rally was planned in Kiev's Independence Square. At the same time, they said they expected Mr. Kuchma's government to provoke or even stage violent demonstrations to discredit Mr. Yushchenko. Mr. Yanukovich's campaign reported what it called evidence of fraud and intimidation against his supporters, including the beating of some observers in a village near Lvov in western Ukraine, a region that is Mr. Yushchenko's stronghold. Both sides stopped short of saying the results should be declared invalid based on the reported irregularities. Mr. Yanukovich, who became prime minister in 2002, has benefited from high-profile support offered by a politician who has no vote in this campaign: Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Putin has lavished attention on Mr. Yanukovich in recent weeks, including a three-day visit last week, in which they appeared together at a military parade to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Ukraine from Nazi Germany. Mr. Yanukovich has also enjoyed an overwhelming advantage in coverage on television, which is either state owned or controlled by allies of Mr. Kuchma's, and the news reports have been overwhelmingly positive. Many stations receive daily orders from Mr. Kuchma's administration about the coverage of political events, the government's critics say. Many of Channel 5's problems may stem from the political sympathies of its major shareholder, Petro Poroshenko, a deputy in Parliament who supports Mr. Yushchenko. Mr. Lyasovsky, the Channel 5 director, insisted that the channel aimed for balanced coverage ''where not only Yushchenko, but representatives of any of the opposition had a chance to say something.'' He said, however, that the station's fate under Mr. Kuchma's government underscored the importance of the vote. ''We have two ways,'' he said, echoing the feelings of many here, ''forward or backward.''", "title": "Rivals in Ukraine Report Violations in Presidential Vote"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Ukraine", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Russia and the Former Soviet Union", "Top/News/World", "Top/News/World/Europe", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Media, Entertainment and Publishing", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Government, Philanthropy and NGO", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe/Ukraine"], "publication_day_of_month": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "World", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Foreign Desk", "print_page_number": "3", "publication_day_of_week": "Monday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/01/international/europe/01ukraine.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "01UKRA$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Two months shy of her seventh birthday, the champion mare Azeri probably is not finished racing, her trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, said Sunday. Azeri could be among several notable Breeders' Cup starters who will be back next year, going against a trend in which many top horses are retired early to be bred. Among the eight Breeders' Cup winners on Saturday, only Speightstown will be retired. The winner of the Sprint, he will be sent to WinStar Farm in Kentucky, where he will stand at stud. Lukas and Azeri's owner, Michael Paulson, decided to run her against males in the $4 million Classic rather than against softer competition in the $1 million Distaff, a race for fillies and mares. Azeri ran fifth but may have a chance to add more major stakes victories to her record. ''We haven't seen the end of her,'' Lukas said Sunday. ''I think she's going to run a couple more times.'' Paulson planned to breed Azeri in February, but that would not preclude her from running Nov. 25 in the Falls City Handicap at Churchill Downs or in races early next year at Santa Anita. A victory in the Falls City could sway voters for the Eclipse awards. Azeri's rival for the older filly and mare championship, Sightseek, was retired before the Breeders' Cup. Lukas said he had no regrets about running Azeri in the Classic instead of the Distaff. Azeri earned $120,000 for finishing fifth, pushing her career earnings to $4,079,820. She is the first filly or mare in North American racing to break $4 million in earnings. ''We have no remorse this morning,'' Lukas said. ''We swung for the fences and the ball fell back onto the field.'' Ghostzapper, who won the Classic, will also remain in training next year as a 5-year-old. ''Ghostzapper is a very exciting horse, and I think I owe it to the racing public to run him next year,'' said his owner, Frank Stronach. ''I will race him in America. I don't plan on any races outside the country. We won't be going to Japan or Dubai with him.'' The trainer Bobby Frankel said Ghostzapper would most likely return in the Metropolitan Mile on Memorial Day at Belmont, which would kick off a summer campaign leading to the 2005 Breeders' Cup, which will also be run at Belmont. Frankel used his news conference Sunday at Lone Star Park to campaign again for Ghostzapper, who he said should be voted Horse of the Year. The only other strong competitor for the title is Smarty Jones, who was retired shortly after running second in the Belmont, ending his bid for a Triple Crown. ''This horse, you can run him six furlongs or you can run him as far as you want,'' Frankel said of Ghostzapper. ''He'll go head to head or he'll come from 20 lengths out of it. And he doesn't carry his racetrack around with him. He's a dream horse and he might as well be a superhorse. Horse of the Year is a no-brainer.'' The Filly and Mare Turf winner, Ouija Board, who is based in England, will also race next year, with a return trip to the Breeders' Cup part of the 2005 plans for her. Ashado, the Distaff winner, has been sent to the Palm Meadows training center in Florida, where she will be prepared for her 4-year-old campaign. Wilko, the Juvenile winner, has been turned over to Craig Dollase, a trainer based in Southern California, and he will be pointed toward the Kentucky Derby. None of the previous 20 Juvenile winners have won the Derby. Pleasantly Perfect, the 2003 Classic winner, sustained a minor injury when finishing third in the Classic, the trainer Richard Mandella said. ''He came out of it a little jarred up behind,'' Mandella said. ''It doesn't look like anything serious, but we'll run him through a scan.'' Pleasantly Perfect may still run Nov. 27 in the Japan Cup Dirt. That would be his final start before being retired and sent to Lane's End Farm in Kentucky, where he will stand at stud. Storm Flag Flying, who was second in the Distaff, has also been retired. She will be bred to A.P. Indy.

''I've known some police chiefs who now hope their hometown team doesn't win because controlling a big crowd can be so difficult,'' said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, an organization of police chiefs meant to promote smarter law enforcement. The problem of crowd control had largely disappeared decades ago, said Mr. Wexler and several big-city police chiefs. That changed with the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in 1999, when 35,000 protesters were drawn to the talks and the police sprayed tear gas and rubber pellets at many demonstrators. ''The W.T.O. demonstrations were a real groundbreaker; it really woke up the police,'' said Seattle's current police chief, Gil Kerlikowske. Dealing with crowds has forced the police to search for new and effective ways to maintain order. ''Dealing with these kinds of crowds, particularly if people have been drinking, is such a no-win situation,'' Mr. Wexler said. ''It is very difficult for police chiefs to manage the competing priorities in these situations, allowing people to exercise their First Amendment rights while protecting public safety.'' He added: ''Police chiefs know they can control 99 percent of a demonstration, but if one officer does anything wrong, they will be held accountable. Crowd control is a real drain on resources, and there is always the threat of litigation.'' Since the 1992 riots in Los Angeles after the acquittal of four officers in the videotaped beating of the motorist Rodney King, the police have come to realize that the constant presence of video cameras means whatever they do may be captured on tape and broadcast. A result is that many police forces now devote much more time to planning and training for demonstrations, and have invested heavily in what are termed less-than-lethal weapons. It was one of these new weapons, a FN Herstal pepper-spray pellet gun, that killed the Emerson College student in Boston after the pennant-clinching game, the police here have said. The student, Victoria Snelgrove of East Bridgewater, was hit in the eye by the pellet, which was supposed to break up on impact and release a small cloud of disabling gas. It is not supposed to be aimed above chest level, according to warnings from the manufacturer. Two young celebrators on Lansdowne Street at Fenway Park also suffered injuries that evening, with one cut above the lip by a pellet and another with pellet fragments that penetrated his skull. Kathleen O'Toole, Boston's police commissioner, has appointed an independent commission, headed by a former United States attorney here, Donald Stern, to investigate. Several other cities also have the FN Herstal pellet-spray guns but have not used them. Seattle is among them, and Chief Kerlikowske dispatched a team of senior officers as observers over the past year to cities where demonstrations were expected, including Boston during the Democratic National Convention in July, New York during the Republican National Convention in August and September and Savannah, Ga., in June during a meeting of the Group of 8 leaders. ''By far the best tool is having a large number of officers you can deploy,'' Chief Kerlikowske said. He has used officers on bicycles to move ahead of demonstrators or to form blocking cordons. ''Especially with sports demonstrations, I just don't see effective weapons except for a large number of officers,'' he said. The Seattle police are equipped with Taser stun guns that fire an electric shock. But Chief Kerlikowske said they would not be useful in dealing with large numbers of demonstrators packed tightly together or hiding behind one another. Tasers are more effective in dealing with people suffering from mental illness who are threatening an officer, so the officer does not have to fire his gun, he said. The trouble is that except for New York, no city has the deep reserves of police officers needed for crowd-control duty, said John F. Timoney, Miami's police chief, who was formerly the police commissioner in Philadelphia and before that first deputy commissioner in New York. While New York has 36,000 police officers, Chief Timoney said, Boston has only about 2,200 and Miami only 1,100. At the Democratic National Convention in Manhattan in 1992, Chief Timoney said, he was able to put 4,000 officers at the scene to prevent violence. Mr. Timoney got his own taste of dealing with demonstrators in Miami last November during a meeting of the Free Trade Association of the Americas. The demonstrators, some of whom had protested at the World Trade Organization in Seattle, started hurling bottles and setting fire to cars on the fourth day of the event, Mr. Timoney said. ''We then made a decisive move on them, clearing them back six or eight blocks,'' he said. But when his officers fired pepper balls, a less high-powered version of the weapon used in Boston, ''It was clear they were not working.'' ''After it was over, I didn't understand why these things didn't work, so I went out in a parking lot and let myself be shot by a pepper ball,'' Mr. Timoney said. ''I felt a stinging in my chest,'' he said. ''It hurt. But as far as releasing pepper spray, I didn't smell anything. So I decided the weapon was a waste of time.'' The Miami police are now trying out another technology, a liquefied form of pepper spray that can be fired at demonstrators up to 20 feet away like a squirt gun, Mr. Timoney said. In Boston on Saturday for the celebratory parade after the Red Sox won the World Series, the police were more successful in dealing with excited baseball fans than they were after the pennant victory. This time, they deployed a huge number of officers as the Red Sox paraded through the city. The crowd, estimated by the city at 3.2 million people, was the largest ever in Boston, according to Mayor Thomas M. Menino. Only 20 people were arrested for disorderly conduct or public drunkenness, the police said. Twenty people were also taken to hospitals with minor injuries.", "title": "Student's Death Returns Crowd Control to the Fore"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/U.S.", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Massachusetts", "Top/News/U.S./New England", "Top/News", "Top/News/Sports/Baseball/Major League/New York Yankees", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Law Enforcement and Security", "Top/News/Sports/Baseball/Major League/Boston Red Sox", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Massachusetts/Boston", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Massachusetts"], "publication_day_of_month": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "U.S.", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "National Desk", "print_page_number": "12", "publication_day_of_week": "Monday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/01/national/01crowds.html", "print_column": "5", "slug": "01CROW$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "John Barczak has had a lot of time to think about what he wants in a president. In a sense, he has had nothing but time. Mr. Barczak is spending at least 35 years in a maximum security prison for committing a double murder. ''I killed a couple of friends,'' he recently explained, dressed in jailhouse blue at Maine State Prison here, about two hours northeast of Portland. ''Got in an argument and shot them.'' Still, Mr. Barczak, 45, a self-described moderate independent who says he is concerned about Iraq and the economy and ''worried about the Supreme Court,'' is as engaged as any other voter. That is because he is a lot like any other voter, able to cast a ballot in federal, state and local elections. He has voted ever since he went to prison for the 1987 murders. And this year, he cast his vote for the candidate of what prides itself as the law-and-order party: President Bush. ''Kerry can't make up his mind,'' Mr. Barczak said. Maine and Vermont are the only states that allow felons to vote while behind bars, a controversial issue in much of the country. In most states, felons can vote only after they get out of jail. In seven states, they cannot vote at all unless, after their release, they successfully petition for their voting rights to be restored. Several states, including Utah and New Hampshire, have outlawed inmate voting in recent years, and some legislators in Maine have been trying to do the same. ''I just was horrified when I realized they could vote,'' said Mary Black Andrews, a state representative from York, Me., whose first husband was a Maine state trooper who was shot and killed in the line of duty. ''I just don't think that they deserve that right if they've been convicted of a violent crime.'' Massachusetts used to let felons vote while in prison, but that was before three inmates tried to form a political action committee in 1997 to lobby for cheaper telephone calls and better medical care. Paul Cellucci, then the governor, opposed the prison PAC and proposed a constitutional amendment to stop inmate voting, which passed in 2000. Vermont's commissioner of corrections, Steven M. Gold, is a supporter of inmate voting and says no one has tried to stop it in that state. ''The vast majority of inmates are going to return to their community,'' Mr. Gold said, adding, ''that very basic and important right of voting is part of trying to get them functioning as taxpayers, rather than tax users.'' In Maine and Vermont, inmates can vote (by absentee ballot) on everything, including the election of judges and how much money is spent on the police in their hometowns. And while voter apathy is an even bigger problem behind bars than in society at large, Maine and Vermont officials say more prisoners seem to be voting this year, fueled by issues like the war and by voter registration drives conducted by inmate advocates and groups including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Even Maine and Vermont prisoners held in other states can vote in their home states. Because of overcrowding, about 400 of Vermont's 1,800 inmates are housed in a prison in Beattyville, Ky., and this year, inmate advocates visited there and registered 104 Vermont prisoners to vote. ''There's almost a childlike excitement here,'' said Kirk Wool, 44, one of the Vermonters in Kentucky, who is serving 29 to 73 years for a sexual assault conviction, and said he ''hadn't begun voting until actually after my incarceration.'' But now Mr. Wool, inmate No. 263524, says he feels so empowered by voting that ''if I had chosen politics instead of crime, call it arrogance, but I believe with my ability to touch people, my ability to speak, I believe I very well could have been governor of the state of Vermont.'' One might think that criminals would be a solid liberal constituency, given liberals' generally stronger support for prisoners' rights. But interviews suggest there are a number of conservatives behind bars. Take Joe-Pete Saucier, in the Maine prison serving his fourth year of a 14-year sentence for vehicular manslaughter after he led the police on a nine-mile chase before crashing his pickup, killing a woman who was a passenger. Mr. Saucier, 27, comes from Democratic stock: his aunt was a state representative and his father was appointed to a commission on juvenile corrections by a Democratic governor, Joseph E. Brennan. ''I had a treehouse built from Brennan for Governor signs,'' he said. But Mr. Saucier is a registered Republican. He voted for Mr. Bush because ''I think he needs to finish what he started,'' he said. Mr. Wool voted to re-elect Gov. Jim Douglas of Vermont, a Republican, because he appointed a commission on prison overcrowding, and Mr. Wool hopes he will bring Vermont inmates back from Kentucky. No one recalls politicians specifically stumping in the cellblocks. ( A spokesman for Gov. John E. Baldacci of Maine said ''he'll stick with the Rotary and the Kiwanis Club.'') But inmates pay attention, reading newspapers, watching television, and even perusing campaign leaflets that are mailed to registered voters like themselves. Mr. Saucier voted for Mr. Baldacci in 2002 because he liked what he said when he visited to meet with prison guards. One avid watcher of the presidential debates was Thomas Karov, serving 20 to 30 years for kidnapping and aggravated assault. (''I went to my ex-wife's house and I wouldn't let her leave there for a couple of hours,'' he said.) ''I don't think much about the economy because I'm in prison, you know what I mean?'' said Mr. Karov, 60, from the Northern State Correctional Facility in Newport, Vt. But Mr. Karov says that he considers issues like ''how big this deficit is getting'' and that ''I have a son that's 20 years old and I don't want to see him ending up in Iraq.'' He was ''thinking of a protest vote for Nader or a write-in for one of the dead presidents,'' but has changed his mind. ''I didn't want to waste my vote,'' he said. ''I voted for Kerry reluctantly.'' Not that the prison constituency is likely to sway an election. Inmates register in the town they lived in before they were incarcerated, so they do not become a voting bloc in the towns where prisons are located. And many do not vote. Maine State Prison logged its biggest voter turnout this year -- about 100 of the 880 inmates. Still, as Mr. Wool, the would-be governor of Vermont, said of his fellow Vermont inmates, ''If all 1,800 of us vote, you have families that are connected to those 1,800, and that's more votes.'' And the dignity of being allowed to vote means a lot, Mr. Wool said. ''When I register for my absentee ballot, I get a slew of brochures,'' he said. ''You see yourself in this little cell and yet these people with all this power and freedom are reaching out to you, too. It gives me hope, it really does.''", "title": "When the Voting Bloc Lives Inside a Cellblock"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/U.S.", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Maine", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Vermont", "Top/News/U.S./New England", "Top/News", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/Issues/Crime and Public Safety", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Maine", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Vermont", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Maine", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Vermont"], "publication_day_of_month": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "U.S.", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "National Desk", "print_page_number": "12", "publication_day_of_week": "Monday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/01/politics/campaign/01prison.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "01PRIS$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "It was perhaps the finest play on what might have been the finest day for the Jets' secondary this season. When the Jets played at Miami last month, cornerback Donnie Abraham stepped in front of a pass from Dolphins quarterback Jay Fiedler and returned it 66 yards for a touchdown. On that day, the secondary -- which held Fiedler to 196 yards passing, intercepted two of his passes and did not allow a touchdown pass for the only game this season -- appeared to be on the rise. As the Jets and the Dolphins prepare to meet again tonight at Giants Stadium, the secondary is trying to rebound after a 13-7 loss to New England last week in which its flaws -- miscommunication, coverage lapses, missed tackles -- were on full display. But tonight, like last month, the secondary may look to Abraham, its quiet leader, for inspiration. After missing eight games last season with a fractured right shoulder blade, Abraham has made an impressive return. He has authored two of the Jets' biggest defensive plays this season and has been perhaps the steadiest piece of a sometimes shaky secondary. Abraham's success comes as little surprise to Coach Herman Edwards, who said it had simply been delayed a year by injury. ''To me, Donnie was going to have a good year last year, but he got hurt,'' Edwards said. ''I said that in camp, you just see that he was back to his old self.'' Abraham wasted little time this season showing that he was back. In the opener against Cincinnati, he scooped up Rudi Johnson's fumble and returned it 41 yards for a touchdown in the Jets' 31-24 victory. Two games later, Abraham picked off Fiedler's pass in a 17-9 victory. While the coaching staff would welcome those kind of big plays again, they might be just as happy if the secondary was simply able to limit the number of them it surrenders. The Jets have given up nine passes of 30 yards or more this season after allowing a dozen last season. A secondary that finished 2003 ranked 10th in the N.F.L. has slipped to 18th, despite the addition of two new starters, cornerback David Barrett and safety Reggie Tongue, through free agency and another, safety Erik Coleman, through the draft in what the team hoped would be an upgrade. Because of the problems in the secondary, the Jets plan to unveil a three-player rotation at the safety positions tonight with Coleman, Tongue and Jon McGraw. McGraw, a starter until getting injured shortly before the opener, has been used mostly in the team's dime, or six defensive backs, formation since his return in Game 2. At first glance, the matchup between the 5-1 Jets and the 1-6 Dolphins appears lopsided. But Miami's defense, ranked fourth in the league entering the weekend, kept the last game close. The Jets may also be tested by the return of Dolphins receiver Chris Chambers and running back Travis Minor, who missed the game last month because of injury but figure to energize a Miami offense that is third worst in the N.F.L. Last week, Chambers and Minor each scored a touchdown in a 31-14 victory over the St. Louis Rams. Edwards said that newness in the secondary might have contributed to its struggles. After the loss to New England, the defensive coordinator Donnie Henderson, a former defensive backs coach, began taking more time to mentor the secondary. ''Just to clarify things and get guys all on the same page and to really basically break it back down, almost like training camp: 'Hey, guys this is why we're doing this,''' Edwards said. ''Because you've got a collection of young guys, new guys, guys who've never been in the system.'' Despite being a newcomer to Henderson's system, Abraham, a nine-year veteran, has flourished in it. ''With a system like his, it's more aggressive,'' he said. ''It allows the players to make plays. And whenever a player can be in position to make plays, they're very excited about that.'' Abraham has made the most of his opportunities. His two touchdowns this season raised his career total to five. And he is on pace for his highest number of passes defensed since he was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2000 while with Tampa Bay. It was with the Buccaneers that Edwards first got to know Abraham. In 1996, Edwards, then a defensive backs coach with Tampa Bay, urged the team to draft the 5-foot-10, 192-pound Abraham out of East Tennessee State in the third round. ''I've had him since he was a baby,'' Edwards said. ''I drafted the kid. know how he thinks.'' Edwards thought that Abraham's blend of smarts, instincts and ability would be an asset to the Jets, who signed him as a free agent in 2002 after Edwards's first season as coach. ''He knows down and distance, he knows field position, he gets it all figured out,'' Edwards said. ''And if you keep messing around with that guy'' -- throwing the ball in Abraham's direction -- ''he's going to steal it. That's what he does.''

The Vikings had not lost often enough to the Giants for it to constitute a jinx -- before Sunday, anyway -- but Birk took no chances. He arrived at the Metrodome in a blue Rangers jersey (with Mark Messier's name on the back) and a Boston Red Sox cap, honoring two long-suffering franchises that won titles after long championship droughts. The sartorial talisman failed to help. Unable to run the ball, the Vikings (boasting the N.F.L.'s top-ranked offense) could not score until the fourth quarter in a 34-13 loss, Minnesota's fourth in five games to the Giants since a 41-0 drubbing in the National Football Conference championship game after the 2000 season. In three seasons under Coach Mike Tice, the Central Islip, N.Y., native who grew up a Giants fan, the Vikings are 0-3, all at the Metrodome. That led Birk to reconsider his choice of ensemble. ''I may have to burn it now,'' he said. The Giants have been nothing but bad luck for the Vikings and quarterback Daunte Culpepper. Two years ago, Tice benched an ineffective Culpepper during a 27-20 loss. Last year, when a 29-17 Giants victory wrecked Minnesota's 6-0 start, the owner Red McCombs ripped the team in the locker room. Three more losses followed as the Vikings' season unraveled, and Minnesota missed the playoffs. A 5-1 start this season put the Vikings atop the N.F.C. North and revived playoff talk. But on Sunday, the Vikings' offense sputtered without Randy Moss. Moss, Minnesota's Pro Bowl wideout, was limited by a right hamstring strain that he sustained Oct. 17 at New Orleans. Against the Giants on Sunday, he played sparingly in the first half and did not catch a pass. Unable to go full speed whenever he ran downfield, Moss walked out for the second half wearing a gray T-shirt, sweat pants and sandals. Culpepper, who threw only three interceptions in Minnesota's first six games, had two Sunday, both inside the Giants' 35. Culpepper finished 24 for 42 for 231 yards and a touchdown. The Giants limited the Vikings to 93 yards on the ground and converted 3 turnovers into 17 points. Tice used up both his replay challenges in the first 12 minutes, with neither resulting in a reversal. By the time Mike Cloud's touchdown run made the score 34-0 early in the fourth quarter, about 10,000 from the announced crowd of 64,012 had left. ''We didn't hold on to the ball and we couldn't run the ball,'' Tice said. ''We didn't sustain our blocks. I really could go on and on and on. I've got a list.'' Culpepper said: ''They had our number today. As you could see, everything that could have gone bad for us, it did. Everything that could have gone good for them, it did.'' The rookie running back Mewelde Moore's mental gaffe on Minnesota's fourth offensive play foreshadowed the day. Moore, the team's leading rusher, muffed a Culpepper pass behind the line of scrimmage -- clearly thrown backward -- but neither Moore nor his teammates chased it. Giants linebacker Kevin Lewis recovered, leading to Steve Christie's 50-yard field goal. Tice challenged the play, although it did not appear close, and lost. Michael Bennett replaced Moore for the next series. Moore said of the ruling: ''I was really surprised. It's just one of those things where you've got to have a little more awareness about it.'' Moore, Bennett and Moe Williams shared time until Moore left the game with a twisted left ankle. So ended a strange week for the Vikings. A Sports Illustrated story quoted McCombs as saying he would pick up Tice's $1 million contract option for next year, but McCombs later told reporters that he would not decide until after the season. McCombs refused multiple interview requests and did not go to the locker room; he walked from the field to a waiting white Ford Excursion. Now Tice faces the difficult task of figuring out how to revitalize the Vikings' offense until Moss is healthy. ''He's a big part of our offense,'' Birk said, ''a big part of our passing game, and a big part of our running game, too.''

''We're in siege mode,'' I said. Political ads blanket the airwaves day and night. Battles are staged with lawn signs. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the progressive tradition still has a foothold, and you see block after block of John Kerry signs, with a scattered few for President Bush. Some are homemade. Rage has effected a heightening of diction in the hope of eloquence. ''KERRY BURY BUSH!'' one reads, and, just underneath, ''End his execrable abominations.'' Another, just across the Mississippi River in Wisconsin, announces ''Bush Is a Big Fat Liar,'' but in true Midwestern style is decorated with multicolored flowers. Progressives in Minnesota have still not recovered from Senator Paul Wellstone's death in a plane crash in 2002 during his re-election campaign. Then, the ubiquitous green ''Wellstone!'' bumper stickers and lawn signs defiantly stayed up long after Norm Coleman, a Republican, was elected. Mr. Wellstone's memory remains sacred to Democrats and supports a grievance in the presidential campaign -- ''What Would Wellstone Do?'' signs are everywhere. The division between the state's traditional Democratic Farmer-Labor progressives and its new radical conservatives is so wide that one liberal friend refers to the Minneapolis suburbs as ''enemy country.'' At dinner parties, our guests promise that they won't talk about the presidential campaign, and then helplessly return to it. One acquaintance says that he thinks about the state's politics constantly and has concerns about his own emotional health. ''I've become a maniac,'' he says quietly. ''It's like the beginning of a civil war.'' The political center here shifted drastically between when I left Minnesota 30 years ago and when I returned last year. Elmer L. Andersen, the state's Republican governor from 1961 to 1963, now 95, his faculties still very much intact, eloquently endorsed the Kerry-Edwards ticket in The Minneapolis Star Tribune. He was promptly denounced by current state Republicans as out of step. Not to be outdone, a better-known former governor, Jesse Ventura, appeared at a news conference in St. Paul wearing a Navy Seals cap, a new beard and a sport shirt. Looking like the subject of a Ralph Steadman cartoon, he stood alongside Angus King, a former governor of Maine, and nodded while Mr. King endorsed John Kerry. Mr. Ventura himself remained mute before getting into his Porsche and driving away. As I drive on I-35 from Minnesota to Iowa, I pass one partisan cornfield after another, this one fronting Bush signs, that one lauding Mr. Kerry. In fact, you are not safe from politics anywhere. In dog obedience class, our keeshond has been sporting a ''K-9's for Kerry'' kerchief. A lady with a King Charles spaniel approached my wife a week ago and said, ''John Kerry is not fit to rule!'' My wife, a stickler for usage, asked, ''Don't you mean govern?'' But by then the lady had turned on her heel and walked away.

For a moment, my wife and I stand on the street corner, delighted by the dreamy spectacle. Then we grow wary. ''Is this the circus?'' I ask her, and she glances over her shoulder. It is indeed the circus, but for a moment we half-expect that a rally may be gathering, that suddenly a crowd of sign-waving Republicans will bear down on us, chanting. After months of swing-state intensity, it doesn't seem such a surreal possibility. For months, the election has hovered over us like bad weather. At the gym, the banks of televisions in front of the treadmills are all tuned to different stations, and as I jog, the threatening ads pop up on screen after screen. In my neighborhood, most yards sport bouquets of three or four political signs. Politically energized children steal them on their way home from school. One neighbor claims that he's had four Kerry posters taken in the past few weeks. Another says she saw her Bush sign borne away by laughing teenagers, who tore it in half and threw it in the street. Of course, it's been hard not to get a little carried away. We have been told repeatedly that ''Ohio will decide the election!'' and the responsibility is nerve-racking. At first I tried to be civic-minded, and worked constructively to register college students. But by late September I was regularly overdosing on Internet blogs, frequently whipped into a froth of outraged ranting. I was not alone. An air of hostility had settled over our public spaces -- nasty bumper stickers on cars on the interstate, enraged fliers tucked under the windshield wipers in the mall parking lots, a shoving and shouting match outside the library. Even the daily newspaper seemed uncomfortable. ''We have decided not to add one more potentially polarizing voice to a poisoned debate,'' The Plain Dealer announced. ''We make no endorsement for president this year.'' ''It's like a horrible, bitter divorce,'' one friend tells me. ''You're like a kid, waiting to find out which one gets custody.'' Meanwhile, my wife is simply tired of the insincere attentions being heaped upon bland old Ohio -- the frequent, eager, telemarketer-like calls from pollsters and political groups; the kindly people flying in from Manhattan and Salt Lake City to help us with our voting; the politicians themselves and their celebrity friends. ''It's like being asked out on a date by someone who secretly thinks you're stupid and ugly,'' she says, and we pause, silent in the cereal aisle of the supermarket. A woman in an armored vest made of Kerry buttons drifts past; a man in a ''United We Stand'' cap eyes her grimly. ''I just hope it's over soon,'' my wife says, and then she sighs.

At home, the party of the sitting president is systematically stomping on the right of black Americans to vote, a vile and racist practice that makes a mockery of the president's claim to favor real democracy anywhere. This will never be seen as a shining moment in U.S. history. There is a hallucinatory quality to the news as Americans prepare to vote tomorrow in what is probably the most critical election the country has faced since 1932. Osama bin Laden made his bizarre cameo appearance on Friday, taunting the president who once promised to get him dead or alive. Commentators have been compulsively reading the tea leaves ever since, trying to determine who was helped by the video, George W. Bush or John Kerry. On Saturday, as if to take our minds off the sideshow, nine more American marines were killed in the Iraq slaughterhouse. It was the deadliest day for U.S. forces in six months. The death toll for Iraqis, which the U.S. government has tried mightily to keep from the American people, is flat out horrifying. Unofficial estimates of the number of Iraqis killed in the war have ranged from 10,000 to 30,000. But a survey conducted by scientists from Johns Hopkins University, Columbia University and Al Mustansiriya University in Baghdad compared the death rates of Iraqis before and after the American invasion. They estimated that 100,000 more Iraqis have died in the 18 months since the invasion than would have been expected based on Iraqi death rates before the war. The scientists acknowledged that the survey was difficult to compile and that their findings represent a rough estimate. But even if they were off by as many as 20,000 or 40,000 deaths, their findings would still be chilling. Most of the widespread violent deaths, the scientists reported, were attributed to coalition forces. ''Most individuals reportedly killed by coalition forces,'' the report said, ''were women and children.'' That people are dying by the tens of thousands in a war that did not have to be fought -- a war that was launched by the United States -- is mind-boggling. Also mind-boggling is the attempt by Republican Party elements to return the U.S. to the wretched days of the mid-20th century when many black Americans faced harassment, intimidation and worse for daring to exercise their fundamental right to vote. A flier circulating extensively in black neighborhoods in Wisconsin carries the heading ''Milwaukee Black Voters League.'' It asserts that people are not eligible to vote if they have voted in any previous election this year; if they have ever been found guilty of anything, even a traffic violation; or if anyone in their family has ever been found guilty of anything. ''If you violate any of these laws,'' the flier says, ''you can get ten years in prison and your children will get taken away from you.'' In Philadelphia, where a large black vote is essential to a Kerry victory in the crucial state of Pennsylvania, the Republican speaker of the Pennsylvania House, John Perzel, is hard at work challenging Democratic voters. He makes no bones about his intent, telling U.S. News & World Report: ''The Kerry campaign needs to come out with humongous numbers here in Philadelphia. It's important for me to keep that number down.'' That's called voter suppression, folks, and the G.O.P. concentrates its voter-suppression efforts in the precincts where there are large numbers of African-Americans. And that's called racism. These are days of shame for the United States. No one writing a civics text for American high school students would recommend this kind of behavior for a great and mighty nation. We have to figure out a way to extricate ourselves from Iraq and rebuild a truly representative democracy here at home. Right now we have a mess on both fronts. It was Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican, who said that ''America's leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.'' That's as good a thought as any to carry with you into the voting booth tomorrow.

This election has even taken the pleasure out of two of my favorite activities, poker and channel surfing. The Philosophy Club, a group of poker players based at the University of New Mexico, has been made so divided by the barrage of hateful political advertisements that neither George W. Bush nor John Kerry can be mentioned without producing hostile stares and icy silences. The club dates back at least to 1973, when I was first invited to make my weekly contributions. It has become a band of elderly brothers. We remain that way only by avoiding politics and limiting debate to matters like the ethics of raising a bet after checking or whether it makes sense to draw to an inside straight. Nonetheless, at a recent game, a suggestion that the Supreme Court rule that neither presidential nominee is eligible for the job because of secretly being born in Bosnia or Burkina Faso or some place, and that both parties be required to pick new candidates -- with an I.Q. test required and disappointing sons of famous men disqualified -- was unanimously approved. For those of us who watch TV with a channel-changer in hand, running up and down the lineup from Channel 2 to Channel 78 in the hunt for something interesting, things have become hectic. One clicks away from a Republican operative outlining Mr. Kerry's flip-flop voting record only to find a Democrat pointing to George W. Bush's foreign-policy blunders. One channel away is our Republican member of Congress warning us that her opponent seldom bothered to vote as a state legislator. Two channels up, there he is, telling us that our representative is a ''friend of Osama bin Laden.'' Now, with polls showing the race undecided, our puny five-vote delegation looks very important. And New Mexicans are not used to this. We are used to being ignored. We love it that way. One of the most popular monthly features in New Mexico magazine is called ''One of Our 50 Is Missing.'' It consists of reports about folks in other states refusing to accept our ''foreign'' credit cards, asking if one needs a visa to visit a friend in Albuquerque, or demanding a foreign postage charge to send the pair of shoes you've ordered from their catalog.

Here's one: the humor category is dominated by liberals and left-leaning authors. In fact, 95 percent of the sales in the political humor section comes from the left. Whether this means that conservative writers have no sense of humor, or that publishing houses fail to recognize it, is worthy of study -- or even loud protest from the right. Indeed, the right seems convinced that booksellers and publishers are trying to influence the election by publishing and prominently displaying books that attack President Bush. In stores across America, angry citizens can be found poring over book displays and tallying up the number of titles according to their political persuasion. If they don't like the mix, they run to their phones and complain to their favorite radio talk-show host. Pity the poor bookseller who gets caught in the middle. Citizens on the left, also believing the news media is out to get them, play a few tricks on bookstores themselves. A favorite tactic is to remove books by the likes of Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, et al., from the shelves in the politics section and hide them in a subject area that gets limited traffic (see ''Parenting''). Another tactic is to remove book jackets and throw them in the trash, a crime we haven't been able to do much to prevent. Not surprisingly, bookstore warriors on the left and the right have discovered an ingenious method of advancing their cause: They purchase in bulk books that attack the candidate they oppose to create the illusion that everybody in the country is eagerly scooping up dirt on the guy they want to bury. Booksellers call it ''stuffing the bestseller lists,'' an act that does not set off any known McCain-Feingold penalties. As an aside, the practice of bulk-buying has caused many a publisher to misread demand and print more copies, many of which become remainders or door-stoppers the day after the election. This happy state of affairs for booksellers is called ''ka-ching, ka-ching!'' Books from the left tend to sell better in the blue states; books from the right in the red states; and in the toss-up states, the split is -- you guessed it -- about 50/50. And consider this disturbing little dose of reality: Informal polls taken by our store managers indicate that some 70 percent of our customers say they have no intention of reading these books; 15 percent say they will; and 15 percent are undecided. One Kansas City customer said, ''I'm buying this book to show people where I stand.'' Another in New York said, ''I'm buying this book because the author agrees with me.'' Efforts to poll undecided voters have been futile at best, suggesting that persuadable folks in a presidential election year know enough to stay away from bookstores. Inundated as they are with phone calls and doorbell ringers, the last thing the undecideds need to hear is a bookseller saying, ''Wanna buy this book?'' Finally, one last bulletin: Liberal books sell at lower price points, and especially in paperback, while conservative books sell mostly in hardcover. Whether this suggests impending class warfare is not yet clear.

''Senator Kerry does not have the judgment or the conviction that America needs in a president,'' Mr. Cheney declared during a rally here on Sunday. That is his core message, repeated several times in every appearance for the last few weeks. But it may not be breaking through in the press as much Republicans would like because local reporters in swing states say they are so inundated by candidates and events that they do not always consider his remarks newsworthy, especially when he sticks to the same stump speech. ''The vice president is extremely consistent in his message; he stays right on point, but we've heard it all already,'' Hollis Towns, the managing editor of The Cincinnati Enquirer, said in an interview. Mr. Cheney has been in Ohio twice in recent days. Most candidates rely on stump speeches during long campaigns. But the editors and others said Mr. Cheney was far more reliant on his than President Bush or other candidates. States like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio and Florida are subject to so many candidate visits, sometimes two or more each day, that editors and television news directors have a difficult time sending reporters to cover all of them. Mr. Cheney made four stops in Florida in a 24-hour period last week, three in Pennsylvania as well as two each in Michigan, Iowa and Wisconsin. With so many candidates visiting, ''we try, but we don't have enough staff to do everything,'' said Barbara Maushard, news director for WISN, the ABC affiliate in Milwaukee. As it is, with so many candidates, so many appearances, editors and news directors say they are looking for ''anything that is new that we can build on'' to distinguish the latest visit from the last one, sometimes just the day before. For Sunday's campaign rallies, like every campaign stop the vice president makes, only the most dedicated Republicans were invited, people who are committed to vote for Mr. Bush and are almost certain to show up at the polls. In the audience here were veterans and state Republican Party workers and officials. Because the campaign has little need to sway these people's views, they serve, in effect, as a backdrop. The real target in these carefully choreographed events is the news media which, the campaign hopes, will carry Mr. Cheney's message along with the enthusiastic reactions of the audience. The problem is that by and large, Mr. Cheney's remarks seldom vary. With small changes, he has been making more or less the same speech for weeks, though the verbiage dedicated to attacking Mr. Kerry has increased in recent days. His speech here was a shorter version of one delivered Saturday in Nazareth, Pa., which was virtually word-for-word the same as one delivered the day before just 90 miles away, in Montoursville, Pa. Anne Womack, spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney, said she wished there had been more coverage of the core remarks in Mr. Cheney's speech but added that she has generally been pleased with the news coverage. ''Obviously it is up to editors and news directors to decide what they want to cover,'' Ms. Womack said. In the campaign's final two days, Mr. Cheney is running a frantic schedule, visiting Ohio, Iowa, Michigan and New Mexico on Sunday, before making a last-minute, almost hail-Mary visit to Hawaii on Sunday night, trying to capitalize on the perceived softening of support for Senator John Kerry in that traditionally Democratic state. After a red-eye flight back, he has an early morning rally in Colorado followed by two stops in Nevada and a final rally in Jackson Hole, Wyo., where he keeps a home. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Cheney has offering a picture of a bleak future dominated by terrorist threats. He has offered barely a nod toward domestic policy concerns, unless asked. His approach has changed hardly at all for weeks. In Mr. Cheney's core remarks, he denigrates Mr. Kerry as an unprincipled opportunist, citing positions taken during his Senate career and statements he has made since he began running for president. But little of that makes it out of the halls where Mr. Cheney appears. After an appearance in Wilmington, Ohio, last Tuesday, as an example, The Cincinnati Enquirer and Columbus Dispatch both published modest articles that included just two or three sentences near the end from Mr. Cheney's core speech. The articles focused instead on the debate over the cache of missing explosives missing in Iraq, or on one participant's question about how long the military will have to be stationed in Iraq. Ben Marrison, the editor of the Columbus Dispatch, said: ''If they just hit the internal play button and recite the stump speech, that doesn't inspire us to give it good play.'' Mr. Marrison added that he believed the Cheney campaign did not really care about newspaper coverage but instead hoped for time on the local television news. The campaign vigorously disputes that. Ms. Womack noted that while the speeches may not vary a great deal, at some of his events supporters can ask him questions on any subject. In Waukesha, Wis., on Wednesday, Ms. Maushard's station dedicated one minute and eight seconds on the 10 o'clock news to Mr. Cheney's evening appearance, including a 50-second excerpt of Mr. Cheney's speech. Mr. Cheney has added new riffs to his standard speech in the last two weeks. One takes Mr. Kerry to task for saying in an interview that he hoped terrorism could be reduced to the point that it was just a nuisance. And last week, starting on Tuesday in Florida, he added a few sentences attacking Mr. Kerry for criticizing the Bush administration's handling of the missing explosives in Iraq. An article in The Milwaukee Journal on Thursday focused on that with barely a mention of Mr. Cheney's core message. When Mr. Cheney visits smaller towns, quite often the news media, which may not be used to such visits, is more enthusiastic. Before his stop on Tuesday in Lake City, Fla., population 10,000, The Lake City Reporter ran three articles over several days. One said he might come, the next one said he would come. A third on Tuesday advised readers that he was arriving. And the next day the paper ran a news article and an editorial, which said the vice president had ''dazzled the crowd,'' concluding that it had been ''a historic day.'' But the editorial added: ''Cheney spoke for 45 minutes and stuck to the party lines that we have all heard in sound bites many times before.''

''I hope you all are going to vote,'' he told Misty and Paul Williams on the steps of their home on Manitoba Court, getting nods of support. ''We want your vote. This is a very important election.'' The neighborhood, Ward 62, went for Mr. Bush by a 12-vote margin in 2000, campaign aides said, a result Mr. Edwards sought to help reverse with a choreographed canvass of six houses in a state that is essentially deadlocked and could prove pivotal to the victor. The doorstep pitches came on a day that was all about marshaling voters to the polls. The day also included an appearance at a black church in Jacksonville, Fla., and rallies in Latrobe, Pa., and this small town 90 miles northeast of Des Moines. Mr. Edwards showed a populist touch, in speech and manner. He spoke from the bed of a pickup truck -- painted red, white and blue and with a grinning Kerry face on the sides -- in a schoolyard before his house visits in Columbus. And in these last few days of the race, Mr. Edwards, a former trial lawyer, has been boiling down his message to what sounds like last-minute instructions to the jury, in this case the voters. ''Let's assume you get to the polling place first thing in the morning,'' he said at the Latrobe rally. ''You just dropped the kids off at school, car's run out gas -- sounds familiar, doesn't it? -- and so in the morning you ask yourself, has the price of gas gone up?'' ''Yes!'' the crowd roared back. ''Has college tuition gone up? Is George Bush going to fight for my job as hard as George Bush fights for his own job? Do I want four more years of this or do I want a fresh start with John Kerry in the White House?'' He hit particularly hard on domestic themes like job loss and health care, but he also sought to vouch for Mr. Kerry's bona fides on national defense and terrorism. ''He took bullets for this country when he didn't have to,'' Mr. Edwards said. On Monday Mr. Edwards will rally supporters in St. Paul, Des Moines, Cincinnati and Pensacola, Fla. On Tuesday he will spend much of the day in Florida before arriving in Boston to await election results with Mr. Kerry. On Sunday, as Vice President Dick Cheney headed for Hawaii for a rally, Mr. Edwards conducted interviews by telephone with newspaper reporters from that state, which is usually solidly Democratic but where polls show the race has suddenly tightened. But the focus of the day was on the mainland battlegrounds, including Florida, where Democrats are seeking to avoid a repeat of the recount in 2000 that delivered the state to Mr. Bush by 537 votes. ''We're not waiting for Tuesday, right?'' he said to parishioners at Greater Grant Memorial A.M.E. Church in Jacksonville, letting his drawl run looser than usual. ''No, we're going to go and vote, we're going to vote today, we're going to vote tomorrow. We're going to make sure your votes are counted this time.''

But a decision by the Supreme Court in June seemed to upset those plans as the justices ruled that prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo were entitled to some rights, notably the ability to have their claims that they were wrongfully imprisoned heard by a federal judge. But what the justices meant as to how far the government must go to accommodate the Guant\u00e1namo prisoners has produced a sharp debate now being played out in lower courts. Lawyers for many of the detainees, including the ones named in the Supreme Court ruling, say the Bush administration is purposely ignoring the justices' mandate and stalling. They cite the government's refusal to acknowledge that detainees are entitled to free access to lawyers to make their cases before federal judges. More broadly, they argue that the government is still trying to argue issues it has already lost in the Supreme Court, especially that the detainees have full rights to challenge their detentions in lower federal courts. The Justice Department responded to demands by the detainees' lawyers with language remarkably similar to that it used almost two years ago in the case it has already lost. ''The notion that the U.S. Constitution affords due process and other rights to enemy aliens captured abroad and confined outside the sovereign territory of the United States is contrary to law and history,'' a recent government brief asserts, in an echo of the briefs submitted in the original Supreme Court case. Thomas Wilner, a lawyer for several detainees who were involved in the original lawsuit, said in his brief that the government's motion was ''simply outrageous.'' ''It is filed in direct violation of the federal rules and it simply rehashes the same arguments that were made before, and rejected by the Supreme Court,'' Mr. Wilner said. He compared the government's behavior to the ''massive resistance'' urged by some Southerners in response to the court's landmark desegregation ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. A senior Justice Department official said in response, ''It's easy for our adversaries to say, 'My gosh, when the Supreme Court said that there is habeas jurisdiction, that must mean there are real rights at stake, that the detainees are protected by the Constitution.''' But the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the litigation was continuing, said the court's ruling that prisoners may challenge their detentions in lawsuits called habeas corpus actions left open that question for lower courts. The court, by a 6 to 3 margin, ruled in June that the people held at Guant\u00e1namo as unlawful enemy combatants ''no less than American citizens are entitled to federal courts' authority'' to challenge their detentions. The Justice Department said in its brief that ''the court expressly declined to address 'whether and what further proceedings' would be appropriate after remand,'' as proof the justices left open the issue of whether the government was required to afford the prisoners more rights. But the full sentence at the end of the principal opinion reads, ''Whether and what further proceedings may become necessary after respondents make their response to the merits of petitioners' claims are matters that we need not address now.'' Prof. Anthony G. Amsterdam of the New York University School of Law said he believed that the government's resistance to recognizing the detainees' rights, including the right to a lawyer, to make their cases bordered on the unethical. ''It's simply amazing that they are proceeding as if those cases had not been heard before the Supreme Court and that those arguments had not been heard and rejected by the court,'' Professor Amsterdam said. ''I would not expect a reputable lawyer to split nonexistent hairs that way and treat what was plainly a decision that these people had a right to be in court as if it were nothing.'' He said the government was apparently hoping to delay the day it would have to explain for each detainee the reasons of imprisonment. Prof. Douglas W. Kmiec of the Pepperdine University School of Law said he believed that the Supreme Court ruling in June was ''written in a deliberately incomplete manner so that it found a right to habeas review but left the nature of that review to some district court.'' Professor Kmiec said he believed the government was acting ''well within its bounds and is not obliged to do anything beyond what they have done.'' The senior Justice Department official who asked not to be named said the administration understood that while ''we don't think there is a constitutional right to counsel, we understand there is a sort of a functional right'' under the federal law that covers habeas corpus challenges. The administration has agreed to let lawyers visit with detainees to help them bring habeas challenges but under strict security conditions that prohibit them from discussing some aspects of the cases with the client. Defense lawyers have challenged those restrictions. The administration has also argued that a new legal proceeding it put in place here at Guant\u00e1namo after the Supreme Court ruling, combatant status review tribunals, should satisfy the justices' demand that the detainees get individualized fair hearings. Under that procedure, detainees are allowed to contest their imprisonment but do not have a lawyer and are not entitled to see the evidence against them. So far, about half of the base's 580 detainees have been through such hearings, and one detainee has been sent home after having been deemed not to be an unlawful enemy combatant. Another set of legal proceedings involving the Guant\u00e1namo detainees, war crimes trials before military commissions, is set to resume here on Monday.", "title": "Disagreement Over Detainees' Legal Rights Simmers"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/U.S.", "Top/News", "Top/News/World/Americas", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Cuba", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/Candidates", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Caribbean and Bermuda", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Caribbean and Bermuda/Cuba"], "publication_day_of_month": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "U.S.", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "National Desk", "print_page_number": "15", "publication_day_of_week": "Monday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/01/politics/01gitmo.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "01GITM$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi on Sunday repeated his vow to keep about 550 troops in Iraq after the government confirmed that the decapitated body found on a street in Baghdad was Shosei Koda, a 24-year-old Japanese tourist who was kidnapped by the militant group of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. ''We cannot lose to terrorism; we must not yield to brute force,'' said Mr. Koizumi, who had immediately rejected the group's demand on Wednesday to withdraw its troops from Samawa, in southern Iraq, leveraged by the threat to behead Mr. Koda. The main opposition Democratic Party charged that the deployment of the Japanese troops in Iraq had led to Mr. Koda's death and repeated calls for their withdrawal. But it seemed unlikely that Mr. Koizumi's government would suffer any political setback, since most Japanese seemed to be pointing instead to Mr. Koda's own carelessness. Mr. Koda, who had recently been studying English in New Zealand, reportedly dismissed many warnings in Amman, Jordan, not to travel to Baghdad and took a bus to the Iraqi capital with very little money. Mr. Koda, who was apparently simply curious about the situation in Iraq, did not take necessary precautions in Baghdad and was even seen walking the streets in shorts. Earlier this year, three Japanese who had been taken hostage in Iraq and shown on videotape being threatened with death, and two others taken in a separate incident, were greeted with hostility when they were freed and returned to Japan, and were broadly blamed for having ignored government warnings against traveling to Iraq. Videos of at least four other foreign hostages being held in Iraq brought what is now a familiar mix of hope and grief to their families and countrymen. The French ambassador to Iraq said he had been assured by Sunni Muslim religious figures that two French journalists seized in August -- Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot -- were in good health, Agence France-Presse reported. A new video of a kidnapped Polish woman surfaced late Saturday, lifting hopes among officials in her government, the agency reported. Reuters reported that the distraught wife of a Sri Lankan driver who has been taken pleaded for his release on Sunday. And there was no word on Margaret Hassan, the director of CARE International in Iraq who was abducted Oct. 19 and has appeared in two videos appealing for British troops to leave Iraq. She has also asked for female Iraqi prisoners to be released. Mr. Koda's brother, Maki, 26, speaking on behalf of his family, who had received both hate mail and letters of support in recent days, said, according to Kyodo News: ''We feel strong gratitude for those who had supported us, while we also feel sorry for causing trouble.

It was game day, the start of their long-awaited, repeatedly rehearsed final push to get Republican voters to the polls on Election Day. Blue Bush-Cheney hats were distributed with neatly packed brown envelopes containing maps, voter lists and plastic ponchos. The team captain reviewed dos and don'ts. (Be polite; avoid lawns.) And then, though it was hard to believe anything had been forgotten, a volunteer muttered one more piece of advice. ''Show some passion,'' she said. ''People need to see our passion.'' So it goes here, throughout Ohio and, indeed, all across nearly a dozen swing states where the election is breathtakingly close. Never in the history of American presidential campaigns will so many people be called, visited, handed literature and cajoled to vote than in the final hours of this race. And the side with the better turnout game is almost certain to win the race, strategists say. ''In all my years in politics, I've never seen anything like this from either party,'' said James Ruvolo, chairman of Senator John Kerry's campaign in Ohio. ''Win, lose or draw, neither side will be able to say it didn't put enough resources into Ohio.'' The race's extraordinary closeness was starkly underlined by a Columbus Dispatch poll on Sunday that showed Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry both receiving just under 50 percent of the vote in this state. Out of 2,880 responses, Mr. Kerry received eight more votes than Mr. Bush, the smallest margin in the history of the respected survey. On the ground, Ohio was typical, only more so, of the nearly deafening hum of campaign activity across the nation. Democrats claimed the party had 170,000 volunteers working across the state, a figure that was impossible to confirm. Republicans said they had 85,000 field workers, while independent groups mustered tens of thousands more. Together, the two sides said they planned to call or visit more than one million homes before the polls close. For that reason, some analysts are predicting turnout in Ohio this year could surpass the 77 percent of registered voters who cast ballots in 1992, the highest in recent decades. In a clear sign that the state's 20 electoral votes remain in the balance, all four members of the two major tickets campaigned in the state on Sunday, using raucous rallies and quiet prayer to energize their bases. Mr. Bush was at Great American Ballpark in Cincinnati, Vice President Dick Cheney at the airport in Toledo, Mr. Kerry at a Dayton church and Senator John Edwards in Columbus. Mr. Kerry plans to visit Cleveland and Toledo to close his campaign on Monday. But it was the buzzing activity below the big media events where the campaign duel was most ferocious. And it was not just the two parties: thousands of volunteers with independent groups, from the National Rifle Association to labor unions to evangelical churches to liberal groups like the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN were also feverishly at work on college campuses and in housing projects, gun clubs and suburban malls across the state. The activity was so intense in Toledo this weekend that union canvassers reported finding three or four pieces of campaign literature already stuck on many doors. And volunteers at a Democratic phone bank in south Toledo said on Sunday that many people were getting angry at the repeated calls there were receiving. ''I just tell them the Republicans are making the same calls, and if we don't keep up, we'll lose,'' said one volunteer, Jonathan Warner, 49, of Holland. ''That cheers them up.'' Democratic strategists argued that the flood of calls could only help their case. ''You cannot remind people too often,'' said Mr. Ruvolo, the Kerry state chairman. ''I hope people start saying 'Stop,' because that will mean we've done our job.'' A major wildcard in this year's Ohio campaign is a proposed state constitutional amendment that would ban same-sex marriages and restrict civil unions. John Green, a political scientist at Akron University, predicts the measure will increase turnout among evangelical Christians, a group that tends to vote Republican, by three to four percent over 2000. The organization that has promoted the amendment, the Ohio Campaign to Protect Marriage, has tried to increase that turnout by mailing two million Sunday bulletin inserts to 17,000 churches. It has also hired a firm to call nearly one million homes before Election Day with a recorded message from Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell endorsing the amendment. Phil Burress, chairman of the campaign, said that thousands of Muslim and Amish people have registered to vote for the first time so they can support the amendment. ''On Nov. 2, I can tell you, the church will turn out,'' Mr. Burress said. Voter turnout is important in every presidential election, but more so this year not only because the race is so close, but also because of record numbers of newly registered voters in many swing states, including Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. Motivating such new voters to actually go to the polls is always a challenge, experts said. In Ohio and other states, the Republicans have created programs modeled on the get-out-the-vote operations Democratic-leaning labor unions have used for decades. The Republican strategy -- known as the 72 Hour Campaign, referring to a tightly scripted hour-by-hour plan for the final three days -- was tested in Congressional and local races in 2002, then expanded this year with statewide recruiting and voter registration drives. That effort is culminating now, with huge volunteer drives in Republican strongholds like Cincinnati, the suburbs around Columbus and Dayton, and the rural western border with Indiana. But the Republicans are also hoping to carve into Democratic strongholds like Lucas County, which includes Toledo. On Saturday night at Bush-Cheney headquarters in a suburban Toledo office park, the parking lot was packed with 60 cars, while scores of volunteers inside called voters. Pizza boxes were stacked on long tables where workers prepared packets for canvassers. On the wall, a computer printout said: ''One volunteer = 200 calls.'' Mr. Bush, who won only 38 percent of Lucas County in 2000, does not need to win here to defeat Mr. Kerry, Republicans contend. ''If Bush is in the low to mid-40's'' in Lucas County, predicted Tom Noe, co-chairman of the Bush campaign in northwest Ohio, ''he will win the state.'' Susan Aldersley, 47, from Alexandria, Va., and Mark Sass, 44, from Maumee, Ohio, are two of the party's 3,000 volunteers in Lucas County. Novice campaigners both, they knocked on more than 100 doors in the heavily Republican Toledo suburb of Sylvania on Saturday, politely asking residents to vote. They praised Halloween decorations, cooed over children and petted dogs, even as they gently importuned people to vote. ''Beautiful flowers,'' Mr. Sass told one voter. ''They're fake,'' she replied. But she pledged to vote for Mr. Bush. Thousands of volunteers for both parties have poured into Ohio from other states as well. Dianne Delisi, a state representative from Temple, Tex., was one of nearly 100 from a group called the Mighty Texas Strike Force that knocked on doors for the Bush campaign around Cincinnati on Sunday. ''What these people tell us is they would crawl if necessary to get to the polls because they know how important it is to win Ohio,'' Ms. Delisi said. While Democrats acknowledge the new Republican efforts, they say they have greatly expanded their own turnout machinery with high and low-tech devices. New computer programs have improved their ability to identify Democratic voters, they say. Trick-or-treating families in Toledo distributed literature on Halloween night. And retirees in Columbus wrote personal letters to voters. But the biggest change for the Democratic side is the explosion of independent groups pushing for Mr. Bush's defeat. For months, MoveOn.Org, ACORN and America Coming Together have blanketed low-income, working class and minority neighborhoods across Ohio with literature blasting the Bush administration's policies on jobs, health care and Iraq. America Coming Together says it will have 12,000 volunteers working on Election Day. ''We have more power to decide this election than voters in any other state,'' Maya Pinto, a 23-year-old volunteer with America Coming Together, told a woman at a Toledo housing project on Sunday.

Gen. Shaukat Sultan chatted amiably and boastfully about Pakistan's contribution to the American-led campaign against terrorism. But when the topic of American foreign policy arose, he bristled. ''O.K., tactically we are getting hold of people here and here and here, but then what's the end?'' asked General Sultan, the chief spokesman for Pakistan's military. ''Until the time you shut down the factory, you will keep picking up the products. You don't shut down the factory until you resolve the disputes.'' General Sultan's remarks reflect a growing frustration with the United States by the government of Pakistan, which is perhaps the Bush administration's most important ally in the fight to capture or kill militant Islamists associated with Al Qaeda. Pakistan's army has continually conducted raids and sweeps along the border of Afghanistan, where leaders of Al Qaeda, including Osama bin Laden, are still believed to be hiding nearly three years after they were driven out of Afghanistan. America's failure to resolve festering disputes in the Muslim world, the general said, is undermining whatever Pakistan has done. Privately, Pakistani officials, from top generals to seasoned diplomats, bemoan the American-led invasion of Iraq, saying it reinforced suspicions that the principal interest of the United States was in controlling oil and protecting Israel. General Sultan's fortress-like new office and his frustration with American policy symbolize the quandary of Pakistan's leadership over the American-led antiterror effort. Pakistan's army and government are enjoying the fruits of billions of dollars in American aid, but they are hunted by Islamic militants themselves -- the president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, narrowly escaped two assassination attempts last December. In truth, the problems in Pakistan cannot be easily solved, even with American help, according to independent Pakistani analysts. No one is quite sure what policies, if any, would end support for Islamic militancy. And the failure of General Musharraf's army-dominated government to restore full democracy, crack down on hard-line religious schools that spread militancy and reform a dysfunctional and xenophobic public education system have also contributed to the problem. Whatever the cause, Pakistani perceptions of the United States' efforts to combat terrorism and of President Bush are startlingly dark, according to a public opinion survey conducted by the Pew Research Center this spring. Only 16 percent of Pakistanis support the campaign against terrorism. More than 50 percent said it was motivated by the United States' desire to control Middle East oil, dominate the world and take aim at Muslim governments seen as hostile to America. Only 7 percent of Pakistanis said they had a favorable view of Mr. Bush. Sixty-five percent said they had a favorable view of Mr. bin Laden. The Pakistani government is also facing an enemy that is far different and far more ethereal than the one it expected, according to Pakistani officials and Western diplomats. Instead of emerging as a mass popular movement that could be confronted with dialogue or arrests, Islamic militancy has been driven underground in Pakistan and has metastasized into a small, loosely knit covert movement linked by an enthralling Islamist ideology, according to Pakistani officials. A stalemate, in a sense, has emerged, with the militants unable to carry out spectacular attacks, but the government unable to eradicate the militants. Adding to the complexity of the problem, the angry poor are not the only ones drawn to militant Islam, according to Pakistani intelligence and law enforcement officials. Arrests in the past year have uncovered small numbers of doctors, engineers, college graduates and military members who have joined or aided small cells of militants. Simply arresting or killing Al Qaeda's senior leadership, a strategy Bush administration officials call ''decapitation,'' will not stop the spread of militancy, Pakistani officials say. Instead, they say a broad-based American-led military, political and social effort to eliminate Muslim political grievances and poverty is needed. Over the past year, General Musharraf has been articulating what he calls a ''two pronged'' approach to the campaign against terrorism, a partnership in a sense, between the United States and moderate Muslims to defeat militant Islam. General Musharraf, who backs a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, has called on the United States to do more to resolve festering political disputes involving Muslims. He has also said that Muslims have just as much, if not more, responsibility than the West in confronting militancy. Muslims must confront fundamentalists aggressively, do more to develop moderate forms of Islamic theology and accept Western teaching methods and other modern practices, General Musharraf has said. He calls his new, moderate worldview ''enlightened moderation,'' and his aides say it is a direct attempt to offer young Muslims an alternative to militant Islam. ''We don't want the spread of their ideology,'' Ahmed Khan Sherpao, Pakistan's interior minister, said in a recent interview. ''That is in a way countering the ideology that they are offering.'' But critics of General Musharraf point out that while he makes speeches that are pleasing to Western ears, his record is mixed. When aggressive reforms threaten his grip on power in Pakistan, the general adopts half measures, they say. Talat Masood, a Pakistani political analyst and retired general, applauded General Musharraf's proposed policies, but said the new efforts would fail like past ones as long as military officials continued to fill government posts and stifle political activity. Mr. Masood said that if General Musharraf was to succeed, he must practice the ''enlightened moderation'' he preaches. Supporters of General Musharraf, including American officials, counter that his crackdowns on Qaeda-linked militants have been sweeping. In the past seven months, at least 171 Pakistani soldiers have died in an operation to flush foreign militants from isolated tribal areas near the Pakistani border. At the same time, some of General Musharraf's aides have undermined his cause. Pakistani journalists have repeatedly accused General Sultan of making false and exaggerated claims about the arrest of Qaeda suspects in Pakistan. They say that on several occasions, General Sultan has declared civilians mistakenly killed by the Pakistani Army to be militants linked to Al Qaeda. The general has also shown an eagerness to blame others. Asked about the source of militancy in the country's remote tribal areas, where thousands of young men have taken up arms alongside foreign militants, General Sultan made no mention of the Pakistani government's historic neglect of those areas, the poorest and most backward part of the country. ''The factory is not really in the tribal areas,'' he said, referring to the conditions that turn young men into militants. ''The factory is in Afghanistan. If the situation in Afghanistan is stabilized, this will cool down.''

But the poll registered an increase in Mr. Bush's job approval rating, as well as an increase in the number of Americans who said the nation was heading in the right direction. Republicans described this as evidence that Mr. Bush was picking up speed in these closing days of the campaign, but Democrats dismissed the numbers, saying that both figures remain dangerously low for an incumbent. A majority of voters -- and an overwhelming number of African-Americans -- said they were concerned that their own votes would not be counted properly, and one-third said they expected to encounter problems when they went to vote, the poll found. Nearly 80 percent of black respondents said they expected that some states would make a deliberate effort to prevent them from voting tomorrow. The anxiety appears to be a legacy of the disputed election of 2000: half of respondents in this latest poll said they did not think Mr. Bush legitimately won the presidency in 2000, compared with 45 percent who considered the outcome legitimate. And this campaign does not appear to have done much to burnish Americans' view of the way the country picks its president: 51 percent described it as the most negative presidential campaign in their memory. The poll found that Mr. Kerry's supporters were far more likely to expect trouble at the polls than were Mr. Bush's supporters. The results suggest that whatever happens tomorrow, the bitterness that has gripped the nation for this election year -- indeed, for the four years since Mr. Bush won the presidency in disputed circumstances -- seems unlikely to lift any time soon. Fittingly enough, this final pre-election Times/CBS News poll shows that the race is not much different at the end than it was in March, when Mr. Kerry emerged as his party's presumptive nominee. The president has 49 percent, compared with 46 percent for Mr. Kerry. A number of other polls made public over the weekend suggested that the race was tied or that Mr. Bush had a slight lead. The findings underscore what both sides view as the single most important factor in determining the outcome of the presidential race: which candidate does a better job turning out supporters. At a time when pollsters watch for evidence of late campaign shifts and movement, Mr. Bush's job approval rating has risen to 49 percent from 44 percent two weeks ago. Incumbent presidents with job approval ratings under 50 percent are almost invariably defeated. The public's view of his handling of foreign policy and the war in Iraq has also edged slightly upward. And there has been a slight increase in another measure that has been ominously low for Mr. Bush, the direction the country is heading in: 43 percent now think the country is moving in the right direction, compared with 37 percent two weeks ago. That is the highest number since the capture of Saddam Hussein. Still, 55 percent of respondents said the country was heading in the wrong direction, continuing a trend that has long threatened Mr. Bush's prospects, and the overwhelming majority of those said they were planning to vote for Mr. Kerry, the poll found. And Mr. Bush has yet to draw support from 50 percent of the voters; should he continue to stay below 50 percent, Mr. Bush would need Ralph Nader, the independent, to help him defeat Mr. Kerry. Mr. Nader drew 1 percent of the vote in the poll. The nationwide telephone survey was taken Thursday through Saturday of 920 adults, including 824 registered voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for the entire group, and four percentage points for likely and registered voters. The poll began after the release of the Osama bin Laden videotape, and continued for two nights after that. However, it was was not designed to provide statistically reliable nightly samples that might have measured the impact, if any, of the tape on the election. Two polls released Sunday -- one by the Pew Research Center and a Wall Street Journall/NBC Poll -- found that the videotape had no effect on the race. The most striking finding of this poll, taken on the eve of one of the most contentious elections in a generation, is evidence that the 2000 election -- combined with pre-Election Day accusations of voter disenfranchisement in Ohio and Florida -- has poisoned the view of many Americans about the election system. ''I have a negative feeling about the Republicans because of the last election, and I think they've been working ever since that election to make sure he gets elected again -- they'll do almost anything to get him elected,'' Patricia Wilson, 66, an independent voter who lives in Philadelphia, said in a follow-up interview. ''I have that new disease P.E.A.D. -- the Pre-Election Anxiety Disorder,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''That fits me. I'm so upset I'm afraid I'm going to have a heart attack over it.'' Jason Babcock, 23, a Republican who lives in Tampa, said: ''I live in Florida, and my governor is his brother, so there is some concern. He wants his brother to remain president, so he'll go out of his way to make sure that happens. I don't know what he might or might not do, but he'll sure come up with something.'' The concern about voting particularly sharp among black voters, presumably reflecting both the recent voter suppression controversies in Florida and Ohio, as well as the history of black voter disenfranchisement that framed the civil rights movement. Thirty-six percent of all respondents said they thought there would be a deliberate attempt in some states to prevent blacks from voting, at a time when Democrats have accused Republicans in Florida and other states of trying to discourage turnout among African-Americans. There is a clear racial divide on this issue: 79 percent of blacks said they expected such a deliberate effort, compared with 28 percent of white respondents. ''I'm just afraid it's going to be some of the same things that happened in that last election,'' said Lois Powell, a black retired social worker from Toledo, Ohio, adding: ''I've already voted. I couldn't take the chance of something happening to my vote. I went down to the Board of Elections and I filled out my ballot and I pray that it will be counted.'' Overall, just one third of respondents said that they had a lot of confidence that the votes for president would be counted properly this November; 44 percent said they had some confidence, while 21 percent said they had little or no confidence. And 29 percent said they were very or somewhat concerned that they would encounter problems at the voting booth that would prevent them for voting, or block their vote from being counted. The poll also signaled the problems either Mr. Bush or Mr. Kerry might have in trying to govern such a divided nation: 52 percent said they were ''scared'' or ''concerned'' about what Mr. Bush would do if re-elected; 54 percent said the same thing when asked about the prospect of Mr. Kerry being elected. The poll suggests some marginal improvement for Mr. Bush, although -- as in almost all polls released this weekend -- the two men are effectively tied. Newsweek's survey had Mr. Bush ahead by 6 points among likely voters. In the Times/CBS News poll, among voters who say they are highly motivated and have taken a great interest in the campaign, Mr. Bush is supported by 50 percent, compared with 47 percent for Mr. Kerry. And in likely voters in battleground states, Mr. Bush is the choice of 49 percent of likely voters, compared with 47 percent for Mr. Kerry. How the Poll Was Conducted The latest New York Times/CBS News poll was based on telephone interviews conducted Thursday through Saturday with 920 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 824 said they were registered to vote. The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country. Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey. The results have been weighted to take into account household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, age and education. Based on the 2000 presidential vote, residents of heavily Republican counties, heavily Democratic counties and politically competitive counties were weighted to their proper share of the population. Eleven politically competitive states were oversampled for purposes of analysis and then weighted to their share of the population. Some findings regarding voting were additionally weighted in terms of an overall ''probable electorate,'' which uses responses to questions dealing with voting history, attention to the campaign and likelihood of voting in 2004 as a measure of the probability of respondents' turning out. In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults. For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. For instance, for registered voters it is plus or minus four percentage points. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results. Complete questions and results are available at nytimes.com/politics.

In all cases, Mr. Bush was even or leading Mr. Kerry, though any differences were within the margin of sampling error. Mr. Bush had the support of 49 percent in the latest CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, conducted Friday through Sunday with 1,573 likely voters. Mr. Kerry is the choice of 47 percent, with Ralph Nader at 1 percent. When turnout and the probable decisions of undecided voters are taken into account, the candidates are tied at 49 percent each. The latest ABC News tracking poll, with telephone interviews conducted Wednesday through Saturday, shows Mr. Bush ahead of Mr. Kerry, 49 percent to 48 percent. Ralph Nader was preferred by fewer than 1 percent of the 2,615 likely voters included in the poll. The tracking poll uses new samples each day, and reports the results based on a combination of the most recent days. A three-point advantage for Mr. Bush was measured in the Pew Research Poll as well as the New York Times/CBS News poll. Mr. Bush had 48 percent in the Pew Poll, conducted Wednesday through Saturday with 1,925 likely voters, while Mr. Kerry had 45 percent and Mr. Nader 1 percent. When undecided voters are allocated, Mr. Bush has the support of 51 percent compared with 48 percent for Mr. Kerry. The Times/CBS News poll was conducted Thursday through Saturday with 824 voters. Among likely voters, Mr. Bush was favored by 49 percent while 46 percent preferred Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Nader was the choice of 1 percent. According to the Fox News/Opinion Dynamics Poll conducted Friday and Saturday with 1,200 likely voters, the contest is tied. Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry had the support of 46 percent, with 1 percent of those surveyed planning to vote for Mr. Nader. Among the six polls, the Newsweek Poll reported the largest difference, a six-point advantage for Mr. Bush. The poll, conducted Wednesday through Friday with 1,005 registered voters, reported that 50 percent of likely voters said they would vote for Mr. Bush and 44 percent for Mr. Kerry. Again, Mr. Nader received 1 percent. However, the difference between Mr. Bush's support and Mr. Kerry's was within the poll's margin of sampling error, which is plus or minus 4 percentage points for each candidate. The margins of sampling error for the other polls range from two to four percentage points. Unlike the ABC News Poll, the others were conducted in the conventional manner, using one sample for the length of the survey. Except for the Times/CBS News poll, the results of each survey included voters who said they supported a particular candidate and those who said they were leaning toward a candidate.

In Pennsylvania, an official of the state Republican Party said it sent out 130,000 letters congratulating newly registered voters but that 10,000 were returned, indicating that the people had died or that the address was nonexistent. Mark Pfeifle, the Republican spokesman, said the numbers showed that in their zeal to register new voters, Democratic-aligned groups had committed fraud. And in Michigan, Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land said she had to put out a statement in mid-October about where to send absentee ballots after voters in the Ann Arbor area received calls telling them to mail the ballots to the wrong address. With lawyers and poll watchers descending on battleground states and the presidential race tight enough that every vote could count, elections officials say that charges of voter intimidation and voter fraud, on the street or in courtrooms, are flying more furiously than any one can remember in recent elections. Much of the tone has been set by a propaganda war of sorts between the parties, with the Democrats charging that efforts are being made to suppress the vote and Republicans warning against voter fraud or double voting. In part, the charges are designed by each party to get out their core supporters to the polls. But court battles already under way over such matters as who gets to cast provisional ballots show this is also a serious struggle that could continue in the courts after Election Day. Democrats have tried to walk a fine line. For weeks they made charges that Republicans were working to keep down turnout and deter newly registered voters. But as Election Day has approached, they have moderated their tone, assuring voters that all will be fine at the polls, mindful of surveys showing that reports of confusion can deter voters. In Philadelphia, where turnout among blacks is considered crucial to the Democrats winning Pennsylvania, state Democrats held a press conference last week where the Rev. Jesse Jackson assured voters there would be no disruptions at the polls. Michael Whouley, the get-out-the-vote expert at the Democratic National Committee, held a teleconference with reporters last week to insist that the reports of challenges and confusion at polling places were greatly exaggerated. ''American democracy is working,'' he said. Jenny Backus, another adviser to the D.N.C., said that early voting had gone smoothly, and that Election Day would too. ''For all the Republican talk of beware, beware, millions of Americans are having a perfectly pleasant voting experience,'' she said. Still, Democrats were putting out briefing papers outlining incidents they said were designed to suppress voting or intimidate voters. Republicans say they are trying to prevent people from voting twice in states like Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, where in Philadelphia the number of registered voters is almost as high as the number of voting-age residents. Ed Gillespie, the Republican national chairman, has said that in some critical places registration is even higher than the number of eligible voters, though election officials say such discrepancies can result from people moving. Republicans also say they want to keep those ineligible, such as illegal immigrants, from voting. ''I'm astonished at the lack of concern with the fraud that exists out there,'' said Mindy Tucker Fletcher, an adviser to the Florida Republican Party. Republican supporters in Florida sought to capitalize on Democratic charges of voter intimidation with a radio advertisement over the weekend. ''Republicans won't let us vote? They say it to distract us,'' says the advertisement, which the Bush campaign said was not one of its own. The ad concluded, ''There is no one stopping you from voting, and if you pay attention to what these Democrats are doing instead of what they are saying, you'll vote Republican.'' Caught in the middle are elections officials, trying to sort out which complaints are real. ''I have had an election year I'd never thought I'd experience in my 21 years,'' said Jan Clair, the director of the Lake County Elections Board in Ohio. ''I've had to do so much damage control.'' Ms. Clair said she took solace from the fact that she had gotten only about five calls about the flier saying those who had registered through certain Democratic-leaning groups could not vote. She said the sheriff had gotten fewer than that. ''The majority of people realize that they were bogus on its face,'' she said. Still, she added, ''to have some campaign or candidate spill over into my business to create confusion, that really offends me.'' But her county, east of Cleveland, is not the only one facing problems. In Cleveland, elections officials say people claiming to be from the Board of Elections have gone door to door offering to retrieve absentee ballots -- election officials say there is no such delivery service; ballots must be mailed or dropped off in person. Common Cause, a nonpartisan group that runs a hot line for reports of problems like missing absentee ballots and long lines at polling places, reported yesterday that of 53,252 calls received nationwide, 8,658 have been from Florida, the state where the bitter recount took place in 2000. In fact, the parties are in full combat in Florida. Some Democrats last week seized on a BBC report saying that Republicans had obtained a list of 1,886 predominantly black and Democratic voters in Duval County and suggesting that Republicans could be planning to challenge those voters on Election Day. Asked about the report, Ms. Fletcher, the adviser to the Republican Party in Florida, said it was unfounded. She said that the list was created from returned mail the Republican National Committee sent to newly registered voters and that it showed that some newly registered voters did not have valid addresses. Florida Republicans on Thursday said they had determined that at least 925 felons had either already voted illegally in early voting or had requested absentee ballots. And Ms. Fletcher left open the possibility that the party intended to challenge ineligible voters at the polls on Election Day. ''It's really not a gray area at all,'' she said. \"You either want the laws to be enforced or not.\" Charles H. Lichtman, special lead counsel for the Kerry campaign in Florida, said Republicans were raising the threat of challenges ''to scare people away by talking about intimidation so there's a smaller turnout, which they think favors them.'' Seth Kaplan, spokesman for the Miami-Dade elections department, said the agency has heard of several complaints from harassed voters. ''We have heard sporadic reports of people attempting to inform voters, maybe offering assistance to voters who don't want it, but nothing systemic,'' Mr. Kaplan said. On Thursday, after concerns increased that some polling places would be clogged by challenges to voters, the Florida elections director, Dawn Roberts, sent a memorandum to county elections supervisors emphasizing that any challenges to voters must not delay others from voting and that a challenged voter should still be allowed to cast a provisional ballot that will be considered later by the county canvassing board. Challenges must be made in the form of written affidavits.

The vote comes as talks with European countries over Iran's nuclear activities have so far failed to produce an agreement. The measure was supported by all 247 lawmakers who were present in the 290-member body, with some chanting ''Death to America'' and ''God is great.'' The session was carried live on the national radio. The bill requires the government ''to make use of scientists and the country's facilities'' to ''enable the country to master peaceful nuclear technology, including the nuclear fuel cycle,'' ISNA, a news agency, reported. Iran contends that its nuclear program is entirely for peaceful purposes. The United States contends that it could be used to manufacture nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' monitoring agency, has called on Iran to give up its enrichment program before Nov. 25 or its case will be sent to the Security Council, where Iran could face the imposition of penalties. Germany, Britain and France have taken the lead in trying to negotiate with Iran to persuade it to suspend its nuclear activities. No agreements have been reached so far between Iran and the three European countries. Iran has rejected the offer to give up its fuel cycle in return for aid for its nuclear technology and imports of fuel. The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamid Reza Assefi, sounded more conciliatory on Sunday, saying there has been progress in the talks with the European negotiators. A week ago, he described their proposal as unbalanced. ''Offering Iran a supply of fuel is a positive step, which we welcome, but this must not deprive Iran of its right to nuclear technology for peaceful reasons,'' he said. The bill passed Sunday must be approved by the Guardian Council, a group also dominated by hard-line leaders, before it becomes law. But the bill does not set a date for the government to resume uranium enrichment. The speaker of the Parliament, Gholam Ali Haddad Adel, said the vote was a message to the world. ''The message of the absolute vote for the Iranian nation is that Parliament supports national interests,'' he said. ''And the message for the outside world is that Parliament will not give in to coercion.'' The leader of the Parliament's commission for national security and foreign policy, Aladdin Boroujerdi, said that sanctions had been in place against Iran for 25 years, and that Iran was not convinced that the Europeans would fulfill any commitments they made in the talks. Nevertheless, talks with the Europeans are to resume on Friday in Paris. Mr. Assefi said Sunday that Iran was expecting a schedule from the Europeans to show how they would carry out their commitments. ''We expect that in the course of this meeting the Europeans will specify their precise commitments, concrete and clear, and the Islamic Republic will make the best decision in line with its own interests,'' he added. Political analysts in Tehran said Parliament's action on Sunday was largely symbolic. ''What they did was merely political, to strengthen the position of Iranian negotiators ahead of the Paris meeting,'' said Saeed Leylaz, a political analyst and journalist in Tehran. ''The country's supreme leader is the sole decision maker over nuclear activities and the Parliament or government have no power in this regard. Parliament wanted to send a message that this is our real stance even if the negotiators reach a compromise.''", "title": "Iran Votes To Resume Nuclear Work"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Iran", "Top/News/World", "Top/News/World/Middle East", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Legal", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Middle East", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Middle East/Iran"], "publication_day_of_month": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "World", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Foreign Desk", "print_page_number": "6", "publication_day_of_week": "Monday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/01/international/middleeast/01iran.html", "print_column": "6", "slug": "01IRAN$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Former President Bill Clinton returned home on Sunday night for the first time in months, but except for a few balloons, some letter-sized signs and a lone man carrying an anti-abortion sign outside the Statehouse Convention Center, you might never have known. Still recovering from heart surgery, Mr. Clinton had logged thousands of miles in the last week, rallying earlier in the day in Albuquerque on behalf of Senator John Kerry. But now, introduced by several Arkansas officials and the actor Danny Glover, he was among his own. ''So I had this little operation,'' he began, chuckling, on a stage set with haystacks, pumpkins and mums. Explaining that Kerry officials had asked him to cross the country to other states to campaign, he said he told them: ''Well, I'm sure not going to fly over Arkansas. I'm coming home.'' Speaking for about 30 minutes to a crowd of about 6,000 and looking rail-thin in a long, dark blazer and bluejeans, Mr. Clinton mounted an argument for Mr. Kerry's candidacy. He said that the reasons Mr. Kerry was not leading in Arkansas were Republican rhetoric on gun control and gay marriage, and voters' fear of switching leaders in the midst of a war. He dismissed the first two issues, saying, ''This election is not about guns and gay marriage'' to calls of ''Say it, Bill.'' As for the security issue, he said that Mr. Kerry's supporters needed to go out and persuade people that he was indeed the better candidate. ''I know a lot about this,'' he said in one of the evening's many references to his presidency. ''I did this for you for eight years.'' Mr. Clinton appeared roughly 10 blocks -- along a street bearing his name -- from the soon-to-open presidential library that gleams over the Arkansas River. His visit was the fulcrum in an 11th-hour push meant to catapult Mr. Kerry over the top. In 2000, Mr. Clinton did not campaign here for Al Gore, and many Democrats say that is one of the main reasons Mr. Bush won the state. For months, Arkansas had been a near-ghost town for presidential politics, with the candidates bypassing it on the stump and the campaigns spending their advertising dollars elsewhere. Democrats had all but written it off, and many Republicans had moved it into their win column. But after some polls suggested a tightening race, both sides intensified their efforts, transforming the state into a heaving landscape of dueling advertisements and counterpunching news conferences. Earlier in the week, television and radio stations began broadcasting several new Kerry advertisements paid for by Democrats and Democratic-leaning groups, some featuring Mr. Clinton. The state Republican Party ran three 30-second radio spots, two of them attacking the former president. In the advertisements, Republicans, who argue that Mr. Kerry is out of touch with voters in a socially and economically conservative state, have sought to portray Mr. Clinton as sharing more of the values of New York than of Arkansas, emphasizing that he has not lived in the state for more than a decade. Mr. Clinton, a former governor, shot back with his own Arkansas credentials on Sunday night, saying that the state had been better off economically when he was in Washington, and that ''in the last four years as a private citizen I created more jobs in Arkansas than the Bush administration ever did.'' Kerry officials also say that Arkansans, who have sent large numbers of troops to Iraq, have grown frustrated with Mr. Bush over the direction of the war as well as the economy. They hope that Mr. Clinton will energize core Democratic voters, including women and blacks, and help ''turn around some white men,'' as Rodney E. Shelton, the state director of Kerry's campaign, put it. But precisely how Mr. Clinton will affect the race here is unclear. He is still enormously popular in the state, political analysts say. Asked in a poll released on Wednesday by the University of Arkansas how he would go down in history, 53 percent of those responding chose ''outstanding'' or ''above average,'' while 25 percent answered ''average.'' But it is far from a given that the support Mr. Clinton enjoyed, especially among black voters, will transfer to Mr. Kerry. Rodney Evans, of Little Rock, speaking in the days before the former president's visit, said that although he had voted for Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, this time he would vote for Mr. Bush because of his views on abortion. ''Honestly, that's weighed a lot into my considerations,'' said Mr. Evans, an elder at his church. Speaking of Mr. Bush, he added, ''I think he's a Christian man, I think he's a family man, I think he's concerned about the elderly.'' Mr. Evans said that he was not certain about Mr. Kerry's position on the issue, but that he looked at other issues like employment and welfare reform in making his decision about Mr. Clinton, who, like Mr. Kerry, is an abortion rights advocate. ''It may be kind of crazy to say,'' Mr. Evans, who is black, said, ''but I felt like he really wanted to help African-Americans.''

The tight race here could slip into legal warfare as soon as 6 a.m. Monday, when election officials in numerous counties begin unwrapping completed absentee ballots in preparation for counting. Starting then, Republican leaders said, they will challenge any ballots cast by Democrats who they suspect were ineligible to vote. Democrats say they will be out in force to protect any votes from being unfairly tossed out. Both camps are staging vast get-out-the-vote drives through phone banks and house calls. But holding the line on defections may prove the bigger challenge. A survey released Sunday by the Iowa Poll showed 6 percent of Republicans said they were voting for Mr. Kerry, compared with 2 percent of Democrats voting for Mr. Bush. In 2000, when Al Gore won Iowa by about 4,000 votes, the same pollster reported that the two sides were nearly evenly split on lost votes from within their parties. ''It's going to be that kind of defection that will decide the race,'' said Ann Zelzer, who conducted the Iowa Poll. Her survey showed that support for Mr. Kerry held steady last week at 49 percent among likely voters, while support for Mr. Bush dipped to 43 percent from 46 percent. The margin of error is about 3.5 percentage points. In Cedar Rapids on Friday, Don Palmer, a retired engineering manager and foot soldier in the Republican voter drive, got a taste of party disloyalty after he knocked on Sharon Wellington's door. The voter profile assembled by the party on Mrs. Wellington showed she was a Republican and a highly likely supporter of Mr. Bush, Mr. Palmer said. (The Republican Party bought mailing lists from the National Rifle Association and other conservative groups, and meshed them with other databases and county election records.)But Mr. Palmer wilted when she told him that she supported abortion rights, blamed Mr. Bush for the national debt and anguished over Iraq for ''going on and on, and I don't see an end.'' She said she would vote for Mr. Kerry. Mr. Palmer said that in all, about 30 percent of the people the party had identified as likely supporters of Mr. Bush said they were voting for Mr. Kerry. But Gentry Collins, executive director of the Iowa Republican Party, said that statewide the party was seeing very few defections, and he cited a poll released Sunday by Mason-Dixon for MSNBC/Knight-Ridder showing Mr. Bush ahead in Iowa, Florida and other swing states. John Norris, who ran Mr. Kerry's national field organization and came to Iowa to help with the final drive, said Sunday that about 65 percent of targeted voters contacted by Democratic recruits said they were voting for Mr. Kerry, though modeling had predicted 55 percent would. A wild card in Iowa could be the Democratic ally America Coming Together, which said that through last weekend it had 700 staff members and volunteers soliciting voters in 195 small towns where little campaigning had been done.

The athletic director declined to offer a vote of confidence to the coach. The team needed overtime to beat Division I-AA Furman. So what's next at Pittsburgh? Well, quite possibly a slot in the Bowl Championship Series. The Panthers (5-2, 3-1 Big East) travel to Syracuse this weekend and then play host to West Virginia on Nov. 25 in their remaining conference games. If they win both, they're in a B.C.S. bowl as the Big East's representative. ''I'm tremendously proud of our players,'' Coach Walt Harris said in a telephone interview Friday. ''It would have been real easy to fold up our tents.'' After the Panthers lost to Connecticut, 29-17, on Sept. 30, Harris bore the brunt of some severe criticism. Part of it was residual after an underachieving 8-5 season last year, when the Panthers had the all-American wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald and the all-Big East quarterback Rod Rutherford. Much of the criticism this season started with Harris's decision in the Connecticut game to set up a field goal instead of throwing into the end zone late in the first half on a third-and-goal from the 12. Soon the program was being ridiculed in a local newspaper by Tony Dorsett, the Heisman Trophy winner who led the university to a national championship in 1976. When Harris's agent called for the university to extend the coach's contract, Athletic Director Jeff Long took no decisive action. Harris has two years remaining on his contract, which pays him about $600,000 a year. ''I really don't want to talk about all that stuff,'' Harris said. ''I made a commitment to myself and the team that I wasn't going to get involved in all that stuff. It doesn't really matter.'' Some growing pains appeared inevitable. Pitt lost Fitzgerald, Rutherford and five other offensive starters. Still, the Panthers had a chance to tie Nebraska on the game's final play, ground out overtime victories against Furman and Boston College, and scored 21 fourth-quarter points to beat Temple. But winning their final two Big East games is by no means a given, and the Panthers play at Notre Dame on Nov. 13. Harris is happy that his team has had a week off to prepare for the game at Syracuse on Saturday. Also, as the weeks go by, and West Virginia performs the way it did during a 35-30 victory at Rutgers on Saturday, the luster peels away from the Mountaineers. Also, Harris knows that his young team is getting better. ''You can't say we're as young of a football team as we were seven games ago,'' Harris said. ''Our mistakes are fewer. Our kids have fought through the negative things surrounding us. We're excited to be at this point, but it doesn't mean we've arrived. We've got a lot of maturing to do.'' The B.C.S.: Knowing the Score The seemingly constant changes in the Bowl Championship Series formula have created different philosophies on how to get to the top of the polls. Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops had his team score a touchdown against Kansas two weeks ago with 35 seconds left to boost the final score to 41-10. Utah, on the other hand, has pulled its star quarterback, Alex Smith, in every game because of lopsided scores. Stoops said he probably should have gone in from the 1 instead of having his quarterback take a knee against Texas Tech in the waning seconds of a 28-13 victory. For Stoops, these calls come down to impressing the news media members and coaches who vote in the polls, which comprise two-thirds of the B.C.S. formula. ''Not everyone out there voting sees everything and has 18 TV's watching all the games,'' Stoops said yesterday in a teleconference. ''All they can do is read box scores or look at scores of the game. That being the case, it forces you in a case you may have taken a knee before, you're forced to try to score.'' Utah Coach Urban Meyer said he was still uncertain how the B.C.S. formula worked. ''Someone tells me our rank each week,'' Meyer said in a telephone interview yesterday, ''and then I go worry about our punt protection.'' Meyer said that none of his starters played in the fourth quarter of a 46-16 victory over North Carolina. Few even played in the third quarter. He said he was tempted to keep them in, but he needed to keep his team healthy. He said he would never leave his players in longer to pad a score. ''If you've got a respected coach like Bob Stoops saying that, the system is a failure,'' Meyer said. ''You've got to blow it up and start over. That's not what college football is.'' Stoops said that he would never run reverses or throw the ball while ahead by a big margin, but he saw no harm in running his normal offense. ''I'm responsible for this program,'' Stoops said. ''I'm not sure if it helps us or not in the B.C.S. picture, but you do your best to improve your position.'' Top Florida Teams Can't Bask There are plenty of factors to explain why Florida's three Division I-A superpowers lost on the same day for the first time since 1978. But it is difficult to tie these results together: Georgia beat Florida, 31-24, on a neutral field; Miami lost at North Carolina, 31-28; and Florida State lost at Maryland, 20-17. The University of Florida is an emotional mess after Ron Zook's firing. Florida State cannot find a consistent quarterback. Miami has been hit by injuries and faces the reality of being in the Atlantic Coast Conference, which means that teams like Rutgers are replaced on the schedule with teams like North Carolina. But Zook said he could not find a unifying reason for why all three teams lost. ''I think it's a coincidence in the way that it happened,'' Zook said in a conference call yesterday. If there is a unifying theme, it could be this: the teams are flawed. Miami's rush defense is No. 66 nationally. Florida State is No. 65 in passing offense, and Florida is No. 54 in total defense.

Voter rolls are inaccurate, ID requirements vary and are erratically enforced, partisans try to disqualify likely supporters of their opponents, and lines at the polls can be excruciatingly long. In 2000, as many as six million presidential votes were lost for technical reasons, and this year the number could be even larger. Voters, particularly in battleground states, should head to the voting booth prepared to fight for their vote to be counted: 1. Know where to go. In many states, you will not be allowed to vote if you show up at the wrong polling place. Worse still, you may be given a provisional ballot to vote on that will later be thrown out. Your board of elections can tell you where to vote. If you can't reach the board, a nonpartisan hotline, 1-866-OURVOTE, has a polling place locator. So does the Web site www.mypollingplace.com. 2. Bring proper ID. The rules vary by state. If you have a photo ID, it's wise to bring it, just in case. Too often, poll workers demand ID when it is not required, or demand the wrong ID. If you do not know the law in your jurisdiction, you should check your local board of elections Web site. 3. Review the sample ballot before voting. Ballots are often confusing, and their designs can change considerably from election to election. And as the infamous ''butterfly ballot'' showed in 2000, a poorly designed ballot can trick voters into choosing a candidate they did not intend. If you have questions about how to vote on your ballot, ask a poll worker or poll monitor for help. 4. Check your ballot before finalizing your vote. As we saw in 2000, if punch card chads are not punched out precisely, votes may not be counted. On electronic machines, a brush of the hand can erase or change a vote. On paper ballots, stray or incomplete marks can disqualify a vote. 5. Know your rights concerning provisional ballots. No voter can be turned away in any state this year without being allowed to vote. If there is a question about your eligibility, you must be allowed to vote on a provisional ballot, the validity of which will be determined later. But if you are entitled to vote on a regular ballot, you should insist on doing so, since a provisional ballot may be disqualified later on a technicality. 6. Know where to turn for help. If you experience problems voting, or if you see anything improper at the polls, you may want to get help. There will be nonpartisan poll monitors at many polling places. (There may also be partisan poll watchers, and it's possible one of them may be the person objecting to your voting.) It is a good idea to bring a cellphone, and phone numbers of nonpartisan hotlines like the Election Protection program's 1-866-OURVOTE and Common Cause's 1-866-MYVOTE1. 7. Be prepared for long lines. In some precincts, the wait may stretch into hours. Try to get to your polling place very early in the morning, or between the before-work and after-work rushes. As long as you are in line before the polls close, you are legally entitled to vote. Do not let poll workers close the polls until you have voted.

Electoral politics, as Americans are regularly being reminded these final hard-fought days before the election, is a brutal, messy business, not an antiseptic political science exercise. That said, I hereby confess to feeling disappointed over Senator John Kerry's failure to home in hard on one of the more worrisome domestic policy developments of the past four years -- namely the Bush administration's drastic expansion of needless government secrecy. President Bush's antipathy to open government continues to garner only a trivial level of attention compared with the pressing matters that seem to be engaging the country at the moment, including, in no particular order, the Red Sox, Iraq, terrorism, taxes and the mysterious iPod-size bulge visible under the back of Mr. Bush's suit jacket at the first debate. But the implications for a second term are ominous. Beyond undermining the constitutional system of checks and balances, undue secrecy is a proven formula for faulty White House decision-making and debilitating scandal. If former President Richard Nixon, the nation's last chief executive with a chronic imperial disdain for what Justice Louis Brandeis famously called the disinfecting power of sunlight, were alive today, I like to think he'd be advising Mr. Bush to choose another role model. As detailed in a telling new Congressional report, Mr. Bush's secrecy obsession -- by now a widely recognized hallmark of his presidency -- is truly out of hand. The 90-page report, matter-of-factly titled ''Secrecy in the Bush Administration,'' was released with little fanfare in September by Representative Henry Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Government Reform, and one of the most outspoken critics of the Bush administration's steady descent into greater and greater secrecy. The objective was to catalog the myriad ways that President Bush and his appointees have undermined existing laws intended to advance public access to information, while taking an expansive view of laws that authorize the government to operate in secrecy, or to withhold certain information. Some of the instances the report cites are better known than others. Among the more notorious, of course, are the administration's ongoing refusal to disclose contacts between Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force and energy company executives, or to explain the involvement of Mr. Cheney's office in the awarding of huge sole-source contracts to Halliburton for Iraq reconstruction; the post-9/11 rush to embrace shameful, unconstitutional practices like secret detentions and trials; and the resistance and delay in turning over key documents sought by the Sept. 11 commission. The report lists many other troubling examples as well. Mr. Bush and his appointees have routinely impeded Congress's constitutionally prescribed oversight role by denying reasonable requests from senior members of Congressional committees for basic information. They forced a court fight over access to the Commerce Department's corrected census counts, for instance, withheld material relating to the prison abuses at Abu Ghraib and stonewalled attempts to collect information on meetings and phone conversations between Karl Rove, the presidential adviser, and executives of firms in which he owned stock. The administration has also taken to treating as top secret documents previously available under the Freedom of Information Act -- going so far as to reverse the landmark act's presumption in favor of disclosure and to encourage agencies to withhold a broad, hazily defined universe of ''sensitive but unclassified'' information. Under a phony banner of national security, Mr. Bush has reversed reasonable steps by the Clinton administration to narrow the government's capacity to classify documents. Aside from being extremely expensive, the predictably steep recent increase in decisions to classify information runs starkly counter to recommendations of the Sept. 11 commission geared to strengthening oversight of the intelligence agencies. Not one for self-criticism -- or any kind of criticism, for that matter -- President Bush says he's content to leave it to historians to assess his presidential legacy. What he fails to mention is that he has seriously impeded that historical review by issuing a 2001 executive order repealing the presumption of public access to presidential papers embedded in the 1978 Presidential Records Act. On a superficial level, the hush-hush treatment of this issue on the fall campaign trail might seem perversely fitting. But Mr. Bush's unilateral rollback of laws and practices designed to promote government accountability surely rates further scrutiny by voters. We've learned over the last four years that what we don't know can hurt us. Editorial Observer", "title": "Psst.

Lewis then hurried 16 yards to the Vikings' 22-yard line and, moments later, the Giants had a quick 3-0 lead that ignited a 34-13 rout of the Vikings yesterday. But to the Giants, it wasn't luck at all. It was their coaches' awareness and repetition, and Lewis's alertness and recognition. ''We knew that play is part of the Vikings' package,'' said Lewis, the middle linebacker, who had primarily been a special-teams player during his first four seasons. ''All week my linebacker coach, Billy Davis, and our coordinator, Tim Lewis, kept telling us as we watched film how often the Vikings used that play.'' In other games, Culpepper had thrown that pass to four different players that Lewis identified as ''30, 23, 81 and even 84.'' Numbers, not names. That's how defensive players know the opposing team's offensive players: 30 was Moore, the rookie running back; 23 was running back Michael Bennett; 81 was wide receiver Nate Burleson; and 84 was wide receiver Randy Moss, the most feared Viking, who hardly played yesterday after being listed as probable despite a pulled hamstring. On Minnesota's fourth play, Lewis suddenly saw the ball bounce away from the Viking wearing No. 30. ''I didn't know it was a free ball,'' Lewis said. ''All I knew was that it was on the ground, and when a ball's on the ground, we go for it. There were five other guys behind me going for it too. That's the way we're coached. Turnovers are our brand of football. We need to get 'em and not let them get 'em.'' And as the Giants rebounded from last Sunday's 28-13 loss to Detroit, that brand of football has created a 5-2 record dominated by a plus-12 turnover ratio -- 18 takeaways and only 6 giveaways going into Sunday's return to Giants Stadium against Chicago. Aside from their won-lost record, the Giants' plus-12 turnover ratio is the most obvious imprint of Coach Tom Coughlin and his staff in taking over a team that had a 4-12 record last season and not much football discipline: too many lost fumbles, too many interceptions, too many thoughtless penalties. Had Culpepper's pass been thrown forward, it would have been just another incompletion. But when it was ruled a fumble off a lateral (and ruled a fumble again after further review of the Vikings' challenge), the Giants had the ball. ''Kevin's play was interesting,'' Coughlin said, ''because we were preparing for the bubble screen. We knew that was right on the edge as we were preparing for it all week long. Kevin did an outstanding job preparing for that. It was a lateral, he stayed with it and it turned into a big turnover. That was a heads-up play.'' In the locker room at halftime, with the Giants clenching a 20-0 lead, Tim Lewis and Davis told Kevin Lewis, ''Great play.'' It was the biggest play in Lewis's five seasons with the Giants since being signed as an undrafted free agent out of Duke before the 2000 season. Two seasons ago, he recovered two fumbles and forced one. This season, after the Giants had purged last season's linebackers, he emerged as the starting middle linebacker. And yesterday he made the big play that the Vikings never recovered from. ''I'd seen that play before,'' Lewis said with a laugh. ''When I was at Duke, Wake Forest loved that wide-receiver screen. They'd run six a game.'' In the Vikings' 5-1 start, Culpepper had thrown 19 touchdown passes and only 3 interceptions. Against the Giants, he threw for one meaningless touchdown and two interceptions while playing mostly without Moss, who tip-toed through the first half without a reception. In the second half, he stood on the sideline. ''It started to stiffen up on him,'' said Vikings Coach Mike Tice, referring to Moss's hamstring. ''We didn't want to take a chance of him hurting it again. We've got to find a new personality until Randy is healthy, because the way we used to do things when Randy was healthy doesn't work when Randy is not healthy.'' One thing that didn't work for the Vikings was the backward pass that got away. ''I was miffed why the player didn't cover the ball, didn't play through the whistle,'' Tice said. ''Maybe it was loud, maybe he thought the whistle blew, maybe he got lulled into thinking it was a forward pass and a drop. But we didn't cover the ball.'' Instead, Kevin Lewis covered the ball and hurried 16 yards with it. And there was no luck involved.

They gained 283 yards, collected 83 yards in penalties from the Vikings and absorbed five sacks, and quarterback Kurt Warner fumbled three snaps. How those numbers translated into a 34-13 victory, with no defensive touchdowns to pad the numbers, was a testament to the Giants' ability to score on all of their opportunities, particularly the ones delivered to them by the Vikings' three turnovers. Heading into the game, the Giants were second to last in the N.F.L. in scoring from inside the 20. On Sunday, the Giants scored all five times they reached the red zone. ''The most encouraging thing was when we got opportunities in the red zone, we ran the ball,'' running back Tiki Barber said. ''Four rushing touchdowns, that was big for us.'' In the first quarter, when a 12-yard completion to Amani Toomer set the Giants up with a first-and-goal from the 8, Barber ran for 6 yards on first down and slashed in for the touchdown on second down. Barber scored again on second-and-goal from the 5 in the second quarter. His backup, Mike Cloud, scored twice in the second half, from the 1 and from the 2. On 21 previous trips inside the 20 this season, the Giants had scored only 7 touchdowns. The most noticeable difference from previous games was the absence of running back Ron Dayne, who was not on the active roster. Giants Coach Tom Coughlin insisted that was not because of Dayne's failures in short yardage, but because of personnel needs in other areas. But the Giants' success at the goal line with Barber and Cloud was impossible to ignore. Barber said part of the success was not bunching their formations to signal an obvious run up the middle, which is usually what greets Dayne's entrance into a game. On Barber's second touchdown, the Giants used a spread formation. The call was to throw to tight end Jeremy Shockey if the Vikings covered him one on one, or hand it to Barber if they played a zone. Barber sliced through the middle of that zone for the score. ''We left our best players on the field as if it were a regular situation, and we were able to take advantage of some of the mismatches,'' Barber said. Perhaps the best result for the Giants was being able to take a significant lead in the game and stash the overworked Barber on the bench. Late in the third quarter, Cloud replaced him and rushed for 55 yards on 9 carries, after getting only 9 carries in the previous six games combined. Cloud, though, took a hard hit in the fourth quarter, and Barber had to re-enter the game. Afterward Cloud said he got ''dinged.'' It was not enough to dampen his enthusiasm. ''It felt really good,'' Cloud said. ''When you haven't played in so long, it feels good to get some touches.'' It turned out well for the Giants too, for a change.

Rather than repel him, those conditions appealed so much to Mark Burnett, the immensely successful producer of ''Survivor'' and ''The Apprentice,'' that his next reality television series, ''The Contender'' on NBC, will feature 16 boxers living and training together in Southern California in pursuit of a $1 million prize. Sylvester Stallone is the host, and he and Sugar Ray Leonard are the boxers' mentors. George Foreman and other celebrities are scheduled to appear on the series, for which NBC is paying $2 million an episode. It is to launch in January. But the series is in one fundamental way different from those that Burnett has set on a secluded island or in Donald Trump's Manhattan boardroom with Type A people drawn from a variety of backgrounds who are voted off their islands or fired. This time -- as with Oscar De La Hoya's ''The Next Great Champ,'' which survived four episodes of low ratings on Fox before moving to cable -- Burnett has chosen an industry that is regulated by state athletic commissions and federal boxing law. By doing so, he has set up a clash between the secrecy needed to protect the results of a taped reality series and the wide-open world of boxers fighting in front of a paying crowds that did not have to sign nondisclosure forms (as those who attended ''Contender'' matches did). Reality television is governed by internal rules that foster competition, jealousy, pressure, hatred, love, adventure and drama. The result, in past series, has been to create a winner who is wilier, stronger, more daring, more attractive, more gullible. The boxers in ''The Contender'' had to sign a 28-page participant contract, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. The contract outlined the restrictions they would live under, the extent to which the they would sign their life stories away and the penalties they would incur for disclosing what happened in their hermetically sealed world. The rules add up to a voluntary surrender of some of their civil rights, a characterization that Burnett did not dispute. They have been required to: $(6$) Permit, with no legal recourse, the program to portray them by using potentially ''personal, private, surprising, defamatory, disparaging, embarrassing or unfavorable'' information. $(6$) Allow concealed cameras to follow them in ways that would ''in other circumstances be considered a serious invasion of my privacy.'' $(6$) Agree to let the producers ''make certain misrepresentations to me and others'' about themselves, their rivals and the prize purses. $(6$) Pay a $5 million breach-of-contract penalty if they disclose anything about the series, without authorization by the producers, until after the final episode is broadcast. A $500,000 fine is suggested for those who speak without permission afterward. $(6$) Earn, at times, ''food, food money and/or catering'' at the producers' discretion. At other times, the boxers were told, they would get a ''reasonable supply'' of food. The clauses, first reported by Thomas Hauser on the Web site secondsout.com, are common to reality television -- one, for ''The Contender,'' regulates sexual activity among the boxers as if they were choosing a fianc\u00e9e on ''The Bachelor.'' Speaking on the condition of anonymity, one producer of the show said the most draconian rules were designed to frighten participants into compliance and that it was unlikely a boxer would be sued for $5 million. Burnett plans to promote the boxers beyond the program, and he has received licenses from California and Nevada. So has Brian Edwards, a lawyer for DreamWorks SKG, the co-producer of the series. ''Boxing is broken, no doubt about it,'' Burnett said by telephone last week. ''But if I'm right, and based on my other unscripted dramas, I can take 16 young men, and each of them will leave the contest way ahead of where they came in, in terms of their value to themselves and to us. We know that marketing is the key to their economic success.'' Despite the wall of silence, some results have leaked, and many of the boxers' names are known: Sergio Mora (who has a 12-0 record), Peter Manfredo Jr. (21-0), Jesse Lee Brinkley (23-1-0) and Ishe Smith (14-0). Mark L. Tuft, a lawyer in San Francisco who specializes in the media, said there was no problem in a person agreeing to waive what would be grounds for defamation or invasion-of-privacy claims. ''But what are the outer reaches of this?'' he said. ''I suppose there is a line beyond which it becomes unconscionable.'' Burnett defended his practices and suggested that if some of his famous alumni, like Richard Hatch of ''Survivor'' and Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth of ''The Apprentice,'' were willing to suspend their civil rights for money and fame, so should the boxers. He said that the boxers had representatives read the contracts with oversight by the California State Athletic Commission. ''You can't value the boxers' rights over Richard's or Omarosa's,'' Burnett said. ''Based on the state of boxing, and the value of these men, all of whom came in disenfranchised, pushed aside and lied to, we've kept our word and gave them a fair chance.'' The boxers were unavailable for comment. The California commission has no purview over the participant deals and did not examine them, said Dean Lohuis, the interim executive officer of the agency. ''Our job is to look out for the safety of the fighters and to be sure they were ready,'' he said, adding that the commission kept strict oversight of the bouts. The agreement by the boxers to abide by reality TV rules that do not exist in their normal lives would be useless to Burnett if viewers knew the results of the bouts, which have been taped, except for the final; it will be carried live in April from Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. To shield the results from public view, Burnett persuaded the California State Athletic Commission to waive -- to some critics, violate -- a federal boxing reform law that requires results to be reported to three boxing registries within 48 hours. The purpose of the provision is to protect boxers from being injured in a bout that has not been reported, then taking another match in a state that was unaware of his condition. To counteract the effect of the waiver, the boxers signed contracts that required them to suspend themselves until the final episode is shown. That means that some fighters will be prevented from taking any other fights for at least seven months, or possibly longer. Burnett is paying them ''holding fees'' through April, to make up for any lost income. ''They're not losing much compared with what they were paid in the past,'' he said. Originally, episodes were to start this month, but they were delayed to distance them from the failure of De La Hoya's series. Burnett said it was purely ''common sense'' that results be held back, especially if the boxers' safety was not compromised. ''We're not going against the intent of the law,'' he said. ''Why does somebody want to know? Does the existing way of knowing things make it right? No.'' Chris Mears, chairman of the commission, said that not waiving the reporting rule would have been a ''triumph of bureaucracy over reason.'' ''We don't need to run to the federal government every time we're confronted with an interpretation of rules,'' he said. Sen. John S. McCain, Republican of Arizona, who co-sponsored the boxing reform law, was unavailable for comment. He met with Burnett several months ago, but he has not said anything publicly about the program. But Tim Leuckenhoff, president of the Association of Boxing Commissions, which certifies one results registry, Fight Fax, wrote in an e-mail message that his organization did not approve of the California commission's decision to violate the law. Patrick English, a boxing lawyer who helped draft the federal law, said, ''Local commissions cannot decide what portion of the act they obey and don't obey.'' He added, ''It's pretty clear that California bent itself into a pretzel to accommodate 'The Contender.''' New York State would not have been host to ''The Contender'' if it meant waiving the reporting requirement, said Ron Scott Stevens, the executive director of the New York State Athletic Commission. ''I'd be taking the law into my own hands,'' he said. Stevens said there were other provisions in the promotional contract the boxers signed that he would have challenged, such as how training expenses are paid and how Burnett's group can unilaterally assign a boxer's contract to anyone else, but the fighter cannot do the same. ''Contender'' boxers also had to waive their rights to appeal the results of any prechampionship bout to the California commission. Hauser, a respected boxing writer and a former consultant to the show, said the convergence of the reality and promotional contracts offered the possibility of abuse. ''The people on 'The Contender' may be completely well intentioned and treat the fighters fairly,'' he said. ''But it's not like putting a truck driver on a desert island. This is these boxers' livelihoods. They should be treated with dignity.'' That's precisely what Burnett insists he is doing as he grafts his reality paradigm onto a sport that he says he wants to reclaim.

The prelude had been filled with so much bluster, including the Vikings' prediction that they could not lose three straight at home to the Giants, and the game was filled with the artificial noise that makes the Metrodome sound like the inside of a muffler. In the middle of the din stood the Giants' stubborn nonbelievers, who took it all in and spit it back out. Linebacker Kevin Lewis grabbed that fumble, which the Vikings did not recognize, on the fourth play, and the Giants used it to launch themselves to a 34-13 victory. When the game was over, with Minnesota's only points cosmetically added in the fourth quarter, the fans were gone and the Vikings were left to figure out what had happened. But the Giants knew. After all, they have done it three straight years. ''I think it's that closeness that you know no one's out there for you,'' Lewis said. ''You know the crowd's fighting for them, wanting them to win, and you just want to be a spoiler. You want to spoil their party.'' The Giants have built the foundation of their 5-2 record by blindsiding their hosts, and Sunday they added the Vikings (5-2) to their list of surprised victims that already included Green Bay and Dallas. The Vikings, though, had ample warning. Last season, a Giants team that would finish a pitiful 4-12 came in and defeated the 6-0 Vikings, 29-17. The year before, the Giants won here, 27-20. This performance was, if anything, more surprising. ''I've just been given the only good news from today,'' Vikings Coach Mike Tice said. ''The Giants are not on our schedule next year. Thank God.'' It started with the mystery fumble. Minnesota quarterback Daunte Culpepper threw a pass to his right that bounced off the hands of running back Mewelde Moore. Believing it was incomplete, Moore clapped his hands in frustration and let the ball bounce free. But Culpepper was in front of Moore when he threw it, making the pass a lateral and the ball live. It rocked for a moment on the turf before Lewis scooped it up, and the Giants took over on the Vikings' 22-yard line. The Giants did not turn the turnover into an instant cavalcade of points -- they lost 10 yards and Steve Christie kicked a 50-yard field goal -- but the trend had begun. The Giants forced a punt, then used a 38-yard pass interference penalty on cornerback Corey Chavous, who was trying to cover tight end Jeremy Shockey, to build a touchdown drive that ended in a 2-yard run by Tiki Barber. With 12 total yards of offense, the Giants had a 10-0 lead with 8 minutes 15 seconds left in the first quarter. This was only a week after they had lost a dispiriting game at home to Detroit and were accused by Coach Tom Coughlin of not preparing hard enough. The biggest turnaround came on defense, where the Giants forced the Vikings' top-ranked offense to come unhinged. ''They had our number today,'' Culpepper said. ''As you could see, everything that could have gone bad for us did. Everything that could have gone good for them did.'' Culpepper, who had the fumble on the backward pass tagged to him, also threw two interceptions, one at the end of the first quarter to safety Gibril Wilson and one in the third to cornerback Will Allen. Both led to Giants touchdowns. Early in the fourth quarter, the Giants were up by 34-0. By the time the attendance of 64,012 was announced in the fourth quarter, more than a third of the crowd had left. By the time the Vikings scored, with 9:01 to play, the fireworks and the Vikings' horn sound effects were bouncing off thousands more empty seats. The Giants trotted happily into their locker room with a victory that made very little sense on a statistics sheet. They gained a modest 283 yards, and quarterback Kurt Warner was sacked five times. And with the starting center, Shaun O'Hara, in a hospital with a leg infection, Warner also fumbled three snaps, although the Giants recovered them all. This all came against the team many believed to be the second-best team in the National Football Conference, behind Philadelphia. But to the Giants, it made perfect sense. ''Coach Coughlin gave a great speech last night, talking about the team and about the core and how you'll do anything for your teammates,'' said Shockey, who caught 3 passes for 60 yards. ''I saw a lot of that today from teammates. They made extra blocks on the field. They'd hold a guy up so another one could come in and make the play. Everybody is starting to get the picture here. ''Coach Coughlin is the main thing in this. No one really would imagine outside this locker room that we were going to be in the position we are now.'' That us-versus-the-world attitude carried the Giants into this game and out of Minnesota with a victory. The team, particularly the defense, spent the past week chewing on all the accolades being thrown at the Vikings. The loss to Detroit took the spotlight off the Giants, enabling them to seize the underdogs' role again. ''We were sick and tired of hearing about how good they are,'' Allen said. ''No doubt they've got a good offense. But we've got a good defense. We've got a good team. After a while, we don't want to hear about it. It makes you want to come out here and do this.'' Allen went on to say that the Giants do not care what anybody else says about them, a contradiction that did not seem to derail the sentiment behind it. At 5-2, the Giants can shrug off all the contradictions they want. What they do is not required to make sense. They are the only ones who have to understand the secret. EXTRA POINTS The biggest question marks entering the game was the health of Amani Toomer, the Giants' top receiver, and Randy Moss, the heart of the Vikings' offense. Both had hamstring injuries. Toomer played, making his 119th straight start as a Giant, and seemed to be at full strength. Moss lined up for a handful of plays, mostly as a decoy. By the second half, Moss was out of uniform. Toomer caught 3 passes for 31 yards. Mike Cloud, the Giants' backup running back, was forced out of the game because of a late hit, so Tiki Barber, who thought his game was over, had to go back in. The late duty sent Barber over the 100-yard rushing mark for the fifth time this season, with 101 yards on 24 carries and 2 touchdowns. Cloud ran for 55 yards and 2 touchdowns.

The New England Patriots had become football's sterling exception, a team that wove together victories while most of the N.F.L. lived week to week. But beneath a fast-fading sky, the Patriots played the kind of game that many did not think they had in them, imploding in a 34-20 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday at Heinz Field that shook up the American Football Conference hierarchy. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady stumbled. Cornerback Ty Law limped. The Patriots' 21-game winning streak ended amid a thousand swirling yellow towels and intermittent flashing bulbs. ''They outplayed us, and they outcoached us,'' Patriots Coach Bill Belichick said after New England's N.F.L.-record streak of 18 consecutive regular-season victories went quietly into the night. ''We didn't do anything the way we are capable of and Pittsburgh played an outstanding game. It's what you'd expect to happen when those two opposing forces collide.'' Brady, a two-time Super Bowl most valuable player, barely had time to settle in the pocket before Steelers would poke through holes and smack him around the backfield. When he tried to regain composure, there they were again, as if on an endless loop. Steelers linebacker Joey Porter made himself a permanent fixture in the Patriots' offense, chasing Brady and running back Kevin Faulk, who started in place of the injured Corey Dillon (bruised thigh). Whenever Porter made a meaningful play, he made a kicking motion with his right leg, scooping up grass and dirt with his cleats. His point was taken. The Patriots (6-1) bit the dust. ''A lot of people were saying, 'You guys haven't played anybody,''' Steelers receiver Hines Ward said. ''We were picked third or fourth in the division, but we proved a lot of people wrong.'' The Steelers (6-1) will have the chance to ruin another team's perfect season this Sunday, when they are host to Philadelphia (7-0). ''This just shows the nation that we're a good team in all facets,'' said running back Jerome Bettis, who rushed for 65 yards and a touchdown. ''But if we go out and lay an egg next week it's all for nothing.'' The Patriots did just that on Sunday. Brady threw two interceptions, including one that Steelers cornerback Deshea Townsend returned 39 yards for a touchdown at the end of the first quarter, giving Pittsburgh a 21-3 lead. It was Pittsburgh's third touchdown in a span of 3 minutes 33 seconds. The others came on touchdown passes from the rookie Ben Roethlisberger to receiver Plaxico Burress -- on a 47-yard deep ball, and on a 4-yard touch pass after Porter caused a Brady fumble. ''They all hurt,'' Belichick said of the scores. ''We didn't run well, we didn't throw well and we didn't play defense well. There was not a lot to build on.'' Belichick and his coaching staff usually have opposing quarterbacks for lunch, but Roethlisberger led a poised and proficient attack, throwing for 196 yards and completing 18 of 24 passes without an interception. But the Steelers relied mostly on the ground game, with 49 rushes, and the legs of Duce Staley. Running to the familiar chants of ''Duuuuuce!'' that once greeted him as a Philadelphia Eagle, Staley, who had 125 yards on 25 carries, ran hard between the tackles and briskly around them. One savvy fan held up a sign that read, ''The only 22 the Patriots will see is Duce,'' referring to Staley's jersey number and the end of New England's streak. Staley and Roethlisberger proved a lethal combination against the most complex defense in football. ''They bring guys in from all over the field,'' Roethlisberger said. ''The offensive line did a great job of protecting. Their defense is very complicated. It's all over the place.'' When the Patriots lost Law to an injured foot in the first quarter, it further depleted a defense that had grown accustomed to turning adversity into opportunity. But New England could not match Pittsburgh's aggressiveness. When the Steelers had the ball, they seemed to be a play away from a big strike. The Patriots, conversely, rarely looked so unsettled in the face of a pass rush. ''We got ahead in the game and that helped our guys a little bit,'' the Steelers' defensive coordinator, Dick LeBeau, said. ''We were able to get some pretty good pressure on them, I thought.'' Steelers defensive end Kimo von Oelhoffen said that ending New England's streak did not matter. ''What matters to me is that I know we are a better team right now,'' he said. If recent history is a judge, these two teams could meet again, as they did after the 2001 regular season, when the Patriots defeated the Steelers here in the A.F.C. championship game on the way to their first of two Super Bowl titles. Several Steelers remain from that team, including Ward, who called Sunday's victory ''a little bit of revenge.'' When Belichick met Steelers Coach Bill Cowher at midfield after the game, Cowher leaned in to congratulate him on all the Patriots have accomplished. They had not lost since a 20-17 defeat to the Washington Redskins on Sept. 28, 2003. In a sport of parity, Cowher understands how rare the Patriots' feat was. ''What they accomplished was phenomenal,'' Cowher said. ''I told Bill that I have so much respect for him and what they accomplished. It's a good football team and a class organization headed by a class guy. ''They will be back.''

Nor was the news his delight in the ''pet goat'' sequence in Michael Moore's Bush-bashing film, and his admonition that ''Bush is still deceiving you and hiding the truth from you,'' echoing the central Kerry theme. Nor was it the frustrating fact that our Global Enemy No. 1 is alive and well and still at large. The unremarked news is that this mass murderer evidently seeks a kind of truce. Although some coverage of his pre-election message noted an unexpected ''conciliatory tone,'' we have not fixed on the reason for this change in his attitude. ''Each state that does not harm our security will remain safe,'' bin Laden promised, which was ''why we did not attack Sweden, for example.'' His unmistakable import: if the U.S. were to stop our war on Qaeda terror, which has killed or captured an estimated 75 percent of his closest collaborators, that would be what he called ''the ideal way to avoid another Manhattan '' Stop warring on terror and you will ''remain safe.'' Generals do not call for a truce when they're winning. Only warriors thrust on the defensive become conciliatory, hoping that negotiations will give them time to regroup and resupply. Bin Laden's vain hope seems to be that the defeat of Bush will give him time to buy or steal a horrific weapon as an ''equalizer.'' Bin Laden was the second outsider to try to influence our election in an ''October surprise.'' I suspect the first was Mohamed ElBaradei, the chief U.N. arms inspector, said to be miffed at the Bush administration's refusal to support his bid for an unprecedented third term. He has long known about the presence of ''nuclear trigger'' explosives (evidence of Saddam's nuclear ambitions?) in one of Iraq's thousands of ammo dumps. But, The Wall Street Journal reports that with exquisite political timing, on Oct. 1 ElBaradei sent a ''reminder'' to a Baathist science minister renewing the U.N. interest in these particular explosives. That produced a dutiful letter from the Iraqi bureaucrat to the U.N. nine days later that was promptly leaked to CBS News, which apparently turned to the more credible New York Times to do most of the reporting. CBS originally admitted intending to break its surprise accusations about our troops' failure to secure the ammo on ''60 Minutes'' on Oct. 31, last night, only 36 hours before polls opened. Journalists call that hyping device a ''keeper'' -- holding a story for the moment when it causes the most damage -- which the victim cannot refute until after Election Day, by which time it's too late. (Now CBS claims that the network would never have done such a nefarious thing. Maybe, maybe not; that plan should be part of the investigation by CBS's panel looking into forged National Guard documents.) The Times, to its ethical credit, refused to go along with CBS's planned last-minute ambush and instead front-paged its article one week ago. (Besides, competition was surfacing on the Internet.) That time enabled other network news organizations to cast doubt on the story. In addition, making our forces in the field look bad did not sit well, and the Pentagon was able to show that the 400 tons possibly missed by our advancing troops was one one-thousandth of the 400,000 tons found, secured or destroyed by the coalition. What effect will these two manipulations by outsiders have on America's election decision tomorrow? Until it was partly discredited, the product of ElBaradei's shrewd ''reminder'' damaged Bush by putting him on the defensive, giving Democrats a final-week boost. If Kerry wins, the Egyptian should be chief U.N. inspector for life. But then came the Qaeda tape, followed by Bush's cool, nonpolitical response, and then by Kerry's blunder in trying to capitalize on it. Bin Laden's latest misreading of American public opinion plays to Bush's antiterrorist strength. For now, bin Laden's unwelcome intercession is taken to be anti-Bush overkill. Coming from the fugitive terrorist, it will help ensure the president's re-election. Later, we will understand bin Laden's phony attempt at conciliation to be his first sign of weakness.

Senator John Kerry has never visited as the Democratic presidential candidate and only twice as the likely nominee, in March and April. President Bush has come more often, but, hey, it's his home. How certain is it that Texas's big chunk of electoral votes (34 this year, 2 more than in 2000) will go, once again, to its favorite son, former two-term Republican governor and presidential incumbent? Well, Charles Soechting, the Texas Democratic Party chairman, put it this way: ''If we win Texas this year, we may move the inauguration to Texas.'' But if the president's victory on Tuesday in Texas is not in doubt, sparing Texans an onslaught of television commercials, his plurality may be trimmed this time, some experts say. That would have implications for his popular vote nationwide and other political races in the state, including some fiercely contested Congressional contests. ''There wasn't that big a margin last time and he's not going to come anywhere near that,'' said Richard Stein, a professor of political science at Rice University, who said he had seen a ''phenomenal'' surge in voter interest in the election, whatever that might imply. Richard Murray, a professor of political science at the University of Houston and a leading Texas pollster, said Mr. Bush's prospects in the state had diminished. ''He's clearly not running as well as last time,'' Professor Murray said. In 2000, Mr. Bush beat Al Gore in Texas by 59 percent to 38 percent, with Ralph Nader taking 2 percent of the vote. This time, with Mr. Nader not on the Texas ballot, Professor Murray said some polls had projected a percentage in the mid-50's for Mr. Bush, with a likely margin of 600,000 to 800,000 votes over Mr. Kerry, rather than the 1.4 million of 2000. ''We continue to see him getting 5 percent below the vote in 2000,'' he said, with stronger showings in rural Texas and weaker support in Austin and other metropolitan areas. The latest Scripps Howard Texas Poll offered somewhat more comfort to the Republicans, giving Mr. Bush 58 percent to Mr. Kerry's 32, with 9 percent undecided and 1 percent preferring another candidate. The poll had a margin of sampling error of 3 percentage points. Professor Murray said Mr. Bush's showing in 2000 drew on his strength with independents and Democrats as a ''nonconfrontational governor.'' ''He's been more polarizing as president,'' he said. Republicans deride such projections. ''Fifty-five? No way,'' said Mike Baselice, a Republican pollster in Austin, offering to take a bet on the spot against that low a percentage for the president. ''What I'm seeing looks real similar to what I saw four years ago,'' he said. Alexis DeLee, a spokeswoman for the Texas Republican Party, said she was confident President Bush would better his numbers of 2000 ''as long as we have a fair election.'' ''Everything that George Bush stands for resonates well in Texas,'' she said. Mr. Bush won most of the state's newspaper endorsements, but Senator Kerry was the choice of The Corpus Christi Caller-Times and The Waco Tribune-Herald, close to Mr. Bush's ranch in Crawford, where the local Iconoclast also came out for his opponent, causing a furor. The Austin American-Statesman faulted the president for mistakes but cautiously backed him, angering partisans on both sides. How well Mr. Bush runs in Texas is expected to prove vital in five close Congressional races in districts redrawn by Republicans to help the party maintain or widen its 10-seat edge in the House of Representatives. ''It's hand-to-hand combat, fighting in the streets,'' said Kelly Ferro, a Democratic strategist in Austin. But Mr. Ferro said the Democrats had proved more resilient to the redistricting than the Republicans had expected. ''It wasn't supposed to be so hard for them,'' he said. One big question mark in Texas, as elsewhere, is the voter turnout and how it could skew the results. With Texas one of 23 states that allow early balloting, the turnout has been breaking records. By the end of Friday, after 12 days of early voting, more than 2.2 million Texans had cast ballots in person and by mail in the 15 most populous counties, far more than the 1.5 million who voted early over 14 days in 2000. In 2000, slightly more than one in five voters cast their ballots before Election Day. This year the figure reached nearly 30 percent. The votes remain untallied, but by accepted political wisdom, Democrats benefit more from high turnouts. ''The interest in the state is phenomenal,'' Professor Stein of Rice said. ''Normally 75 percent of voters say they will vote and under 53 percent ended up voting in 2000. Now 97 percent say they will vote.'' The Texas secretary of state, Geoffrey S. Connor, said about 13.1 million Texans were registered to vote, up from 12.4 million in 2000. But because of a population increase, Mr. Connor said, the percentage of registered voters as part of the voting-age population has declined slightly, to 82 percent from 85 percent four years ago. How many will actually vote is a crucial question. Among the closely watched voting groups are Hispanics, who constitute about a third of the population and are projected to split about 65-35 in favor of Mr. Kerry. In 2000, Hispanics accounted for less than 17 percent of the more than six million people who voted in Texas, said Lydia Camarillo of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, a nonpartisan group in San Antonio. This year, she said, the figure is expected to rise to 24 percent of those voting. The youth vote may also prove a vital factor. In 2000, only 25 percent of eligible voters from 18 to 25 voted in Texas, said Mary Dixson, associate director of the Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Participation at the University of Texas. Already, she said, more students at the university had cast ballots in early voting than voted at all in 2000. There have been a few glitches, with some voters complaining that the electronic machines seemed to be recording votes they had not cast. Election officials blamed careless handling of the scrolling wheel that controls the selections.

Now many Christian conservatives say President Bush and his White House have done more to excite those promised voters than any previous administration, putting their predictions to a test. Even beyond the immediate issues about same-sex marriage, abortion or stem-cell research, several conservatives said, the election results could determine their power in the conservative movement and the Republican Party for years to come. ''Republicans were interested in our votes during the election, and then they tended to go away,'' said Dr. James C. Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family and possibly the most influential conservative Christian in the country. ''It changed because of George Bush.'' Other conservatives said they were eager to see the results. ''You couldn't ask for a candidate who is more publicly identified with people of faith than President Bush,'' said Grover Norquist, a conservative strategist who holds weekly meetings of allies in the movement. ''If they don't turn out inordinately for Bush, it would just become known that these guys don't vote.'' If Christian conservatives do not turn out at record levels, said John Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron, ''it is very likely that other factions in the Republican Party will blame them.'' In an interview on Friday, Dr. Dobson said that he had never felt so invested in an election. He said he was nervous, even though as a theological matter he knew it was in God's hands. ''I felt he wanted me this time to pour myself into this, no matter how much pain or stress or physical inconvenience, to try to influence this election,'' he said. ''God may have chosen a different track. I don't perceive it, but he might.'' The stakes are particularly high for Dr. Dobson. Until this year, he had never endorsed a presidential candidate, preferring to keep his public persona aloof from partisan politics to avoid damaging his authority on family matters, he said. ''I have been very reluctant to use my influence in the past,'' he said, ''because if you marry a politician, you could be a widow in four years.'' Turnout levels are nearly impossible to forecast, and polls suggest at least some mixed political emotions in the pews. Recent polls have put the number of evangelical Protestants supporting Mr. Bush at about 7 in 10, roughly the same level as polls showed four years ago, Professor Green said. But in a New York Times/CBS News poll in mid-September, before the debates, 48 percent said Mr. Bush was hiding something about Iraq and 15 percent said he was lying. Still, several prominent conservative Christians said that they are convinced this election will vindicate their long-held predictions that a social conservative candidate could bring millions of evangelical voters to the polls. Dr. Richard Land, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the 16-million-member Southern Baptist Convention, called it ''beyond comprehension'' to think that evangelical Christians might fail to increase their turnout far more than other groups. Many evangelical churchgoers did not think of Mr. Bush as one of them in 2000, he said. ''Now they know he is the real deal,'' Dr. Land said. Dr. Dobson said evangelical Christians were ''more energized this time around than I have ever seen in my lifetime.'' But he added, ''I just don't know if it is going to be enough to counter Bruce Springsteen and Michael Moore.'' If Mr. Bush should lose, Dr. Land said, the Republican Party might turn away from their evangelical allies. But not for long, he argued. ''Without social conservatives, they don't have anything left but chiefs and no Indians,'' he said.

The video, delivered to the Arab news network Al Jazeera and broadcast Sunday morning, was the strongest indication yet that the group Jaish-e-Muslimeen, or Army of Muslims, was holding the hostages as it has claimed, and was adopting the media-oriented tactics of kidnapping groups in Iraq. The three hostages -- Angelito Nayan, a Filipino diplomat, and two women who are election workers, Annetta Flanigan from Northern Ireland and Shqipe Hebibi from Kosovo -- were seized Thursday from their car on a busy street in Kabul. They appeared unharmed but drawn in the video, sitting together against a wall. They were guarded by a militant with a black-and-white checkered scarf wrapped around his face. Leaders of Jaish-e-Muslimeen issued their conditions in telephone calls to news agencies on Sunday. They demanded that the United Nations and the United States and other foreign nations withdraw their forces from Afghanistan, that all of their Muslim prisoners in Afghanistan and Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, be released and that military and police operations to find the hostages and their captors be halted. ''The U.N. should leave Afghanistan, and it should call Britain and America's meddling in Afghanistan illegal,'' the leader of the group, Akbar Agha, 47, told Reuters. He demanded that Kosovo and Britain withdraw their forces from Afghanistan. ''Those who have no military involvement in Afghanistan, like the Philippines, must call Britain and America's meddling in Afghanistan illegal and must stop its contributions through the U.N. for America and Britain's activities,'' he said. He also called for the release of all Muslim prisoners in Afghanistan and Cuba, ''be they Taliban or Al Qaeda.'' Kosovo, a province of Serbia, is under United Nations administration, and it has no troops in Afghanistan. Britain has 1,700 troops here, most of whom are part of the peacekeeping force that is based in Kabul, the capital, and two northern cities. The United Nations spokesman in Afghanistan, Manoel de Almeida e Silva, confirmed that the three hostages shown in the video were the three United Nations employees abducted Thursday in Kabul, and he appealed for their release. ''We can confirm that the video shows our colleagues, Annetta, Lito and Shqipe,'' he said. ''We are relieved that they appear to be unharmed. We call for their safe and immediate release.'' At an earlier news briefing, he said: ''We miss them. And like their friends and families, we worry about them, about their medical and physical conditions and about their emotional well-being.'' ''They come from faraway lands with habits, cultures and traditions that are very diverse. But they have at least one thing in common -- their commitment to serve people who can benefit from their knowledge and expertise. This is why they volunteered to come and work in Afghanistan.'' The leaders of Jaish-e-Muslimeen are known to be former Taliban commanders and are thought to be living in Pakistan, where they first contacted journalists to claim responsibility for the kidnappings. But the Afghan police and intelligence agents are concentrating their investigation on Paghman, a rural area west of Kabul, and they say that a group with criminal links was probably responsible for the abduction and may still be holding the hostages. ''We don't think they are far from Kabul,'' an Interior Ministry spokesman, Lutfullah Mashal, said of the hostages. ''We don't think that they are out of the country. Probably some terrorists are involved in this, but I should say that the one kidnapper that we saw on television was most likely neither a Talib nor a member of Al Qaeda.'' Jaish-e-Muslimeen is a breakaway group of the Taliban that shares the same aims as that militant religious movement but has adopted different tactics, said Rahimullah Yusufzai, a Pakistani journalist who spoke to Mr. Agha recently. The group is opposed to President Hamid Karzai and the election process, wants foreign troops out of Afghanistan and wants a government led by the mujahedeen fighters and guided by Shariah law, the legal code of Islam, he said.

As the candidates themselves made Scripture-laden appeals to congregations in swing states -- President Bush at a Catholic church in Florida and Senator John Kerry at a predominantly black Baptist church in Ohio -- many Christian ministers across the country devoted their sermons to tomorrow's election and its meaning for the nation's future. While polls showed that most voters had already made up their minds, the race was a dead heat and the votes of religious communities were vital to the outcome. America's faithful -- 158 million Christians, 6 million Jews, 3 million Muslims and a million Buddhists and others -- constituted the largest voting bloc, and the passions driven by religious issues have been extraordinary. Decorum, for the most part, was observed yesterday. Christian services visited by reporters in a dozen cities unfolded with the customary prayers, hymns and homilies. But there was an unmistakable political subtext to many of the proceedings -- coded admonitions from pulpits, or ''voter guide'' pamphlets, to choose a ''godly'' leader (Mr. Bush) or vote for ''change'' (Mr. Kerry). Among Catholics, there was no repetition of a Colorado bishop's recent warning that a vote for Mr. Kerry would amount to a sin. But many Catholic pastors emphasized in sermons that abortion, embryonic stem cell research and gay marriage, issues on which Mr. Kerry differs from Mr. Bush and which are anathema to the church, were ''nonnegotiable'' issues -- statements that amounted to endorsements of Mr. Bush. At a half-dozen Jewish services in New York and New Jersey on Saturday and in several Muslim gatherings in New York City on Friday, rabbis and imams also urged followers to vote but were far more reticent in speaking about the candidates; none offered advice on how to vote. Many Christian services yesterday were also neutral, and it appeared to have little to do with the federal law that bars tax-exempt organizations from endorsing candidates or taking sides on issues. ''We don't speak on political issues, per se,'' the Rev. Stephen Lien, pastor of Brentwood Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles, said with a reserve typical of many ministers. ''But we certainly encourage people to be politically active. God is not a Republican and God is not a Democrat.'' But there was no fear of tax-exemption goblins at the Baptist Worship Center in Philadelphia, a largely black congregation in a former supermarket, where Bishop Millicent Hunter was anything but neutral. She said she would not tell congregants how to vote, that she was simply ''sharing the facts'' -- then laid into Mr. Bush. Bishop Hunter said Mr. Bush had ''misled and mismanaged'' the country, taking it from a record surplus to a record deficit, and had ignored education, jobs and health care. ''We need a new direction for America,'' she proclaimed as 1,000 parishioners cheered and Pennsylvania's Democratic governor, Edward G. Rendell, smiled from the front row. Ms. Hunter said Mr. Kerry ''has a plan'' to create jobs, provide health care and prosecute the war in Iraq and against terrorism, and would raise the minimum wage and provide after-school programs for 3.5 million children. Ms. Hunter urged her congregation not to be misled by the president. ''George Bush proclaims himself a man with Jesus in his heart,'' she said. ''That is a manipulation tactic.'' At some conservative Christian services, barely veiled support for Mr. Bush was hard to miss. From a high-tech pulpit backed by two giant screens, the Rev. Wayne A. Barber, pastor of the Hoffmantown Baptist Church in Albuquerque, told a gathering of 300 worshipers that he had no need to mention any candidate by name because ''God has already told you'' the righteous thing to do. Mr. Barber offered a prayer for ''our president, our government,'' and led his flock in prayer. ''Let us pray that the things God stands for, such as life, and pro-life, such as marriage between a man and a woman, are upheld,'' he declared. ''Lord, pray for our election, that you be honored and glorified. That you will make this election such that there will be no question.'' At the Nativity of Our Lord Catholic Church in St. Paul, the Rev. Christopher Wenthe, addressing several hundred worshipers, did not mention any candidate or political party, nor did he use the word abortion. But few could have missed his meaning when he declared that love of humanity ''must begin with the protection of life, from conception to natural birth.'' A 10-page ''Voter's Guide for Serious Catholics,'' which parishioners could take as they left, was more explicit. It urged Catholics to ''eliminate from consideration'' any candidate who opposed church teaching on abortion, euthanasia, stem cell research, cloning or gay marriage. Outside the church, young women under the direction of a nun were placing on windshields copies of an ''official pro-life sample ballot.'' It carried a picture of a baby on one side, of Mr. Bush on the other. At the Calvary Chapel in Fort Lauderdale, an evangelical church with a racially diverse congregation, a guest speaker, Rick Green, a former Texas lawmaker who often talks to conservative groups, told 3,500 worshipers to ''vote for righteousness.'' He directed people to ''voter guides'' in the hallway. One, published by the Christian Coalition, claimed that Mr. Kerry supported abortion and gay marriage. (Mr. Kerry has said he opposes same-sex marriage.) Books, including ''America's Godly Heritage'' and ''Is America One Nation Under God?'' were on sale. On her way out, Maureen Crocco, 58, said of Mr. Bush, ''This is a man who lives out his faith, and I don't see anything wrong with that.'' At the First Assembly of God Church, an evangelical congregation in Des Moines, the Rev. John M. Palmer told 800 worshipers: ''I pray that God gives wisdom to every voter making choices, and that they will support individuals who uphold the sanctity of life. To choose individuals who are committed to biblical ways, and who will lead this nation with a biblical perspective.'' A brochure in the program asked, ''Why Must Christians Vote?'' and quoted Scripture in answer: ''When the godly are in authority, the people rejoice. But when the wicked are in power, they groan.'' Kelli Russell, 17, said she was for Mr. Bush. ''He believes what I believe and I support what he has done in office,'' she said. In Denver, it was the Day of the Dead at the Cameron Church, a United Methodist congregation that honors loved ones and ancestors on the last Sunday of October, on or close to Halloween. The altar was crowded with mementos, and music to ''wake the spirits'' was played. Most of the worshipers, though not all, were Kerry supporters, and some wore buttons proclaiming their allegiance. But the senior pastor, the Rev. Bill Kirton, was nonpartisan in his sermon, focusing on a scriptural beast in the Book of Daniel. ''If you are a liberal you are a beast, and if you are a conservative you are a beast to somebody,'' he said. He advised looking past the election to what he called things that matter. In Cleveland, the Rev. C. Jay Matthews, pastor of the Mount Sinai Baptist Church, a black congregation, recalled a personal political journey that had taken him from Mr. Bush to Mr. Kerry. ''I have supported this president, and I've been a leader in promoting his faith-based initiatives,'' Mr. Matthews said. He even met with the Republican national chairman, Ed Gillespie, on how to raise black votes. But his congregation did not go along, and he had second thoughts as the campaign in Ohio became bitter with negative attacks. ''One of the reasons I've been able to move away from this president and closer to Senator Kerry is that when I look at the Republican ads, that's not of God,'' Mr. Matthews told his congregation yesterday. ''How can you say you're the candidate of God and you're doing that stupid stuff?'' Many leaving the church said they thought Mr. Bush's religiosity had been cynically promoted. Rabbi Mark Kaiserman at Temple Emanu-El of West Essex in Livingston, N.J., took a similar posture on Saturday. ''The pulpit is not a place to tell people whom to vote for,'' Rabbi Kaiserman said. And Sheikh Ahmed Dewidar, imam of the Islamic Society of Mid Manhattan, said: ''Of course I never mention the Democrat or the Republican. I tell them to ask God to guide you to the right thing.''

The victory by the coalition, known as the Progressive-Encounter-Broad-FrontNew-Majority, whose largest faction consists of Tupamaro guerrillas turned politicians, strengthens a trend throughout the continent. As in the last presidential votes in Venezuela, Brazil, Ecuador and Argentina, the candidate most opposed to American-supported free-market policies has defeated backers of those policies. Surveys of voters leaving the polls and early returns indicated that Dr. V\u00e1zquez, an oncologist and former mayor of this capital, would win about 51 percent, just above the majority needed to avoid a runoff. Even before official returns were announced, both of his main opponents had conceded and indicated their willingness to cooperate with him. ''Celebrate, Uruguayans, celebrate,'' Dr. V\u00e1zquez, whose five-year term is scheduled to begin March 1, told the throng by his campaign headquarters at the downtown Hotel Presidente, two hours after polls had closed. ''This victory is yours!'' Tens of thousands of people, some with faces painted in the red, blue and white colors of the Front, took to the streets here, setting off firecrackers, waving banners, honking horns and pounding drums. ''We did it, we finally did it!'' shouted Walter Correa, a meatpacking plant worker. The triumph caps a 33-year effort by the Front to win power by legal means. During the American-supported right-wing military dictatorship that ruled from 1973 to 1985, many Front leaders who were then Tupamaros, as well as members of some other factions, were jailed or forced into exile. The son of a politically conscious oil refinery worker, Dr. V\u00e1zquez visited his father's grave before voting in the working-class neighborhood where he was born and reared. He began his medical and political career in the same district. ''This is a magic night,'' Dr. V\u00e1zquez said at a news conference, paying tribute to Front leaders who did not live to see his victory. He also urged countrymen to ''unite our efforts so that all Uruguayans can live better.'' For Uruguay's two traditional centrist political parties, the Colorados and Blancos, the defeat was traumatic. Together, they have alternated in the presidency for more than a century, but were outvoted even in some middle- and upper-class neighborhoods that historically have supported them. ''The Front clearly has the best of the packages being offered to us, and Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez is obviously a balanced and capable leader,'' said Gonzalo Mendoza, 60, an architect.

Political analysts, pollsters and some opposition leaders have been predicting for weeks that the opposition would lose as many as 100 mayoral posts, including the one in the capital, Caracas, and as many as five governorships. Pro-Ch\u00e1vez governors already control 15 of 23 states, while opposition or independent mayors run 200 of 337 municipalities. The vote includes state assembly seats. Venezuela's opposition has been struggling to remain relevant since losing a referendum to recall Mr. Ch\u00e1vez in August. It blamed fraud for that loss, though diplomats and international monitors declared the election largely free of fraud. Some opposition leaders, citing the possibility of fraud on Sunday, called for a boycott. Others said that would hand Mr. Ch\u00e1vez regions that had been in opposition hands. ''You cannot tell people there's fraud and tell them to vote,'' said Ana Mar\u00eda Sanju\u00e1n, a political analyst at the Central University in Caracas. The abstentions, more prevalent among voters opposed to the government, and lackluster campaigns severely weakened several opposition candidates. Some, like the mayor of Caracas, Alfredo Pe\u00f1a, dropped out, leaving a close lieutenant of the president, Juan Barreto, poised to win. The election was expected to give Mr. Ch\u00e1vez's allies victories in the oil-rich state of Anzo\u00e1tegui. Opposition governors were expected to hold on to Zulia, the historic heart of the country's oil industry, and Carabobo, while adding Nueva Esparta, which had been in the hands of a government ally. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez told voters that expanding the government's power would help him push through contentious legislation, like a bill reining in private television stations, and other measures, like agrarian changes, that his detractors oppose.

Israel may not have electoral votes, but it does have an estimated 100,000 potential American voters, including a large chunk from critical swing states like Florida, Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania. And an estimated 10,000 Palestinian-Americans living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are eligible to vote. Republicans and Democrats here report a surge in voter interest, and cite several reasons: the nail-biting finish to the 2000 election, the close American-Israeli ties and the centrality of regional issues in the current campaign. As a result, both parties have run voter registration campaigns, efforts that increasingly can be done on the Internet. ''We are at an important stage in the war on global terrorism, and that is an issue that resonates in this neighborhood,'' said Kory Bardash, chairman of Republicans Abroad in Israel. A few weeks ago, in an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem, a taxi traveled the narrow streets, broadcasting taped voting advice over a loudspeaker. ''You can vote even if you have never voted or registered before, and even if you never were in the United States,'' the tape said. ''All you need is a Social Security or a passport number.'' Mordechai Adler, a former Chicago resident, led the effort that focused on the close-knit religious neighborhoods in the city, where information spreads instantly by word of mouth. In these conservative communities, the voters favor President Bush over Senator John Kerry. One of the newly registered, a rabbi with a gray beard, said he had not lived in the United States since 1965 and had never voted, Mr. Adler recalled. But he did remember his last address in New York, which was required on the registration form. Mr. Adler said his campaign registered more than 10,000 voters. More than half were from New York, but about a quarter were from swing states with many electoral votes -- Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan -- and by now those voters have sent in their ballots. In the last several presidential elections, Jewish voters in Israel have favored the Democratic candidate over the Republican by around 80 percent to 20 percent, said David Froehlich, who runs the Federal Voting Assistance Program in Israel, and is a former chairman of Democrats Abroad in Israel. He acknowledged that Mr. Bush would make a much stronger showing this time, because of his support for Israel. In addition, Israel was one of the few countries to enthusiastically support the invasion of Iraq. But Mr. Froehlich still predicted that Mr. Kerry would capture 60 percent of the Israeli vote. Israel has one of the largest concentrations of United States citizens living abroad, large enough to potentially tip the balance in some states where the race is very close. Israel could have as many as 6,000 potential voters from Florida, the parties estimate. Four years ago, the state's recount gave Mr. Bush the presidency by 537 votes. In 2000, as many as 20,000 ballots were cast from Israel, Mr. Froehlich said. He said he expected the number to double this year. On the campaign trail, Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry have portrayed themselves as strong friends of Israel, and have criticized the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, now hospitalized. Mr. Bardash held more than 30 voter registration events to seek Republicans from swing states. His group focused on Americans clustered in several areas, including Jerusalem, Raanana, a suburb of Tel Aviv, and the Gush Etzion settlement bloc in the West Bank. ''When we found someone from Cleveland, we were very aggressive, asking them, 'Do you know anyone else from there?''' he said. He said his group registered 2,000 voters from Ohio, 1,500 from Florida and 750 from Pennsylvania. ''I wouldn't turn anybody away, but when you look at the electoral map, some places are hugely important,'' he said. ''One vote from Ohio is worth 100 from New York.'' Meanwhile, Palestinian-Americans have leaned toward the Republican Party, and Mr. Bush's father was a particular favorite because he was seen as taking a tough stance with the Israelis in the early 1990's, when he was president. Many expected the son to be similar. ''Four years ago my friends and I were so excited when Mr. Bush won,'' said Abdul Jawad Jamalalddin, 40, a United States citizen who said he voted for Mr. Bush in 2000. ''But we've all been very disappointed. He supports Israel on every issue.'' Mr. Jamalalddin lives in Fresno, Calif., but was visiting his family in the West Bank town of Deir Debwan, where at least half of the residents hold United States citizenship. Worldwide, an estimated 4.6 million Americans, including military personnel, live abroad and more than half are eligible to vote, the Association of Americans Resident Overseas said. Small numbers do vote, and their votes are not always counted, said Mr. Froehlich.

You have heard the news about the more than 1,100 marines and soldiers who have been killed in Iraq. I had not personally experienced the pain and enormous loss of each of those brave Americans -- until Sept. 14, 2004. That was the day my brother, Maj. Kevin Shea of the Marines, was killed by a rocket attack outside Falluja. It was his 38th birthday. That day started out like any other. I went to work and sent Kevin an e-mail message wishing him a happy birthday and kidding him about how old he was getting. Kevin had been in Iraq for seven months and was expected to return home in several weeks. Sept. 14 was also the day of the primary in Washington State. I left work and went to a church gymnasium near my home where I filled out my ballot and left feeling, in some small part, that I, too, was serving my country. I then drove home to care for my 10-month-old daughter while my wife attended a meeting. I was in my kitchen when I learned that Kevin was dead. When the phone rang, the voice on the other end was that of a Marine chaplain who had accompanied the marines to Kevin's house to inform his wife of his death. I asked about my parents in Washington, D.C. He told me that my mom and dad were being informed by marines in dress blues. (I learned later that my mother would not let them in the house; my father was not home because he was volunteering at a primary election location.) With that one phone call, the reality of the Iraq war hit home. Now, when I read about the death of a soldier or a marine, I can visualize the ripples of grief, pain and anger that will immediately spread through the family and friends. I will be voting in this election, and I sure hope my guy wins. But more important, I hope that all citizens of this great country will recognize their duty to vote. The inconvenience and hassle are a small sacrifice compared with the sacrifice of at least 1,100 other citizens like my brother.

Eagles receiver Terrell Owens is not one to let a slight, or anything else, slide by without a comment. On Sunday, however, he was in danger of being silenced by the Ravens' smothering defense and the Eagles were at risk of losing a defensive struggle and being beaten for the first time this season. But it would take an awfully large muzzle to keep Owens's prodigious talent and tongue quiet for an entire game. After a quiet first half against Baltimore, Owens engineered an 11-yard tackle-breaking, game-deciding touchdown in the fourth quarter as the Eagles went on to a 15-10 victory over the Ravens. Owens punctuated the touchdown with a touchdown dance that mocked the one linebacker Ray Lewis performed, on among other occasions, when he was introduced before Baltimore's Super Bowl victory three years ago. Owens explained the dance with a broad smile, calling Lewis a good friend and saying, ''He's a highlight film, like I'm a highlight film.'' Later, he announced: ''If I score, everybody knows I'm going to try to do something exciting. I think Shannon Sharpe said it best: If you don't like what I do, stop me from getting in the end zone.'' Lewis, the league's dominant defensive player, clearly had another view, first saying he did not see the dance, but then adding: ''If you are going to play a football game, don't be a coward and wait until you make one play and do something. Just play football. What's flattering is that he has me on his mind when he's at home.'' Actually, this kind of game was exactly what Owens had in mind when he forced his way out of Baltimore after he was traded to the Ravens during the off-season by the San Francisco 49ers. Lewis had criticized Owens for that, but Owens, who has already had five 100-yard games, has given the Eagles the spark the offense has long needed. ''This is what I fought for,'' he said. ''I think everybody should be able to see the picture now.'' The victory boosted the Eagles to 7-0 for the first time in franchise history. New England's loss to the Steelers on Sunday left Philadelphia as the only unbeaten team in the N.F.L. By focusing on Lewis, Owens took aim at a star as big, perhaps bigger, than himself. Owens said that he had read comments by Ravens players who said they had shut him down last year when Owens was still in San Francisco. So Owens had planned multiple touchdown dances. The Ravens had allowed the fewest points a game in the league entering this week. They used rolling coverage on Owens early in the game. With their offense handicapped by the absence of three Pro Bowl players -- running back Jamal Lewis, tackle Jonathan Ogden and tight end Todd Heap -- much of the game was lacking offensive production. The first four scores were field goals, and the quarterbacks combined for only 140 yards passing in the first half. With the Eagles leading, 9-3, early in the fourth quarter, the Ravens drove into Eagles territory before running back Chester Taylor fumbled. Until then, the game had gone exactly the way Ravens Coach Brian Billick could have hoped, with his offense minimizing mistakes and letting the defense dictate the game. The fumble opened the door for Philadelphia. Owens's touchdown was the first of the game and was not scored until more than five minutes of the fourth quarter had elapsed, but it was a beauty. A few plays earlier, Owens ran a route on which he was covered by Ravens cornerback Gary Baxter. Baxter told Owens that he would not score on him. So on the touchdown, Owens caught a short underneath pass at about the 9-yard line. The Ravens were playing tight man-to-man, but Owens broke Baxter's arm tackle, changed direction and accelerated to the corner of the end zone. Baxter refused to explain the play after the game, but cornerback Deion Sanders, a guy who knows something about playing to the cameras, did not seem troubled by Owens's style. ''You are starting to see the best of him because he is winning,'' he said. ''T.O. is good for the game. He brings a lot of flavor to a somewhat boring sport.''

Mugabe, a government-controlled newspaper reported Sunday. The newspaper, The Sunday Mail, quoted the acting attorney general, Bharat Patel, as saying that the acquittal on Oct. 15 of Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, ''has many flaws, and we don't think it should stand unchallenged.'' Mr. Patel said the government would file to overturn the verdict in about two weeks. The newspaper quoted him as saying that among other aspects of the decision, the government would challenge the court's ruling as to what constituted treason. Mr. Patel's statement contradicts an earlier declaration by Zimbabwe's justice minister, Patrick Chinamasa, that the government would accept the court's decision even though its view was that Mr. Tsvangirai had been ''wrongly acquitted.'' Mr. Tsvangirai, 52, was arrested and charged with treason more than two years ago after the government produced a grainy videotape in which he was alleged to have discussed the ''elimination'' of Mr. Mugabe with Ari Ben-Menashe, a Montreal political consultant. Defense lawyers later said that Mr. Ben-Menashe had been under contract to the Mugabe government at the time and had been hired to frame Mr. Tsvangirai in advance of elections in 2002 in Zimbabwe, which Mr. Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change lost. After a yearlong trial, a High Court judge ruled on Oct. 15 that the government had failed to prove its case. Mr. Tsvangirai said then that he hoped his acquittal would bring about a ''national reconciliation'' of the country's political crisis. Since then, Mr. Tsvangirai has been barnstorming southern Africa, lobbying regional leaders to press Mr. Mugabe to change Zimbabwe's electoral process before national elections scheduled for next March.

Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, told his cabinet that the ailment that afflicts Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian leader, had not altered plans for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal of soldiers and Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip, which is scheduled for next year. However, Mr. Sharon and his aides raised the possibility that new Palestinian leadership could open the door to the negotiations envisioned under a Middle East peace plan known as the road map, which collapsed shortly after it was introduced last year. ''If and when a new leadership emerges, and fulfills its obligations, then we would be willing to return to the road map,'' said Ranaan Gissin, a spokesman for Mr. Sharon. ''The opportunity is there. It depends on whether the Palestinians seize it. Without Arafat, we believe the chances would be much greater.'' Mr. Sharon has refused to deal with Mr. Arafat, contending that he encourages violence against Israel and is not a reliable partner for peace negotiations. While disagreeing, some Palestinians saw Mr. Arafat's absence as a chance to demonstrate a standfast government. ''We are now talking about how we should prove that we are a mature and responsible nation and that we are capable of remaining united and of withstanding the difficult new circumstances,'' said Ziad Abu Ziyad, a Palestinian legislator. Four years of Israeli-Palestinian fighting have extinguished virtually all political contacts between the sides. With Mr. Arafat sidelined indefinitely, Israelis and Palestinians have raised a wide range of possibilities about how the situation could play out. Some say that if Mr. Arafat passes from the scene, the two sides could find a way out of the current bloodletting and reopen some form of dialogue. Others say that the Palestinians could face internal battles in choosing new leadership, contributing to further lawlessness in Palestinian areas and continued conflict with Israel. Israel's chief of military intelligence, Maj. Gen. Aharon Zeevi-Farkash, told the cabinet that new Palestinian leadership might try to persuade armed Palestinian factions to declare at least a temporary cease-fire with Israel, Israeli radio reported. However, Israel has been skeptical that such truces can hold. One result, the general said, would be increased pressure on Israel to coordinate its Gaza withdrawal with the Palestinians, which Mr. Sharon has resisted. Israel says it will allow Mr. Arafat to return to his compound in Ramallah on the West Bank after his medical treatment in France. However, Mr. Sharon told his cabinet that if Mr. Arafat died, he would not be buried in Jerusalem, which is his long-expressed wish. Israel seized the eastern part of the city in the 1967 war and annexed it, a move that has never been recognized internationally. The Palestinians are seeking East Jerusalem for the capital of a future state. Mr. Arafat underwent additional tests on Sunday at the Percy Army Teaching Hospital southwest of Paris, and aides said he was feeling better. However, doctors are not expected to give a diagnosis of his illness until Tuesday or Wednesday, Palestinian officials said. Mr. Arafat has had a low blood platelet count, and doctors have conducted tests to check for cancer, a viral infection and other ailments, aides said. They say initial tests, at least, have indicated that he does not have leukemia. Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian finance minister, told The Associated Press that he had spoken with Mr. Arafat by telephone. ''Arafat told me: 'I am O.K. I am feeling well. Please tell my brothers there that I am doing well,''' said Mr. Fayyad, who is in the West Bank. ''This phone call is clear proof that President Arafat is fully aware of what is going on around him.'' Palestinian officials have sought to strike a balance since Mr. Arafat was airlifted Friday from his West Bank compound and flown to France. They want to demonstrate that Palestinian institutions are still working despite the absence of Mr. Arafat, who has played a dominant role for decades. However, they do not want to give the impression that they are usurping power while he is away, and they are acting on the assumption that he will return to his former role. The Palestinian prime minister, Ahmed Qurei, convened the National Security Council, a body that Mr. Arafat leads. The Palestinian Legislative Council also met Sunday. Mr. Arafat emerged as the dominant Palestinian leader in the late 1960's, and no other Palestinian can approach his stature. He embodies the quest for statehood, even among Palestinian critics of his leadership. On the Israeli side, Mr. Arafat is almost universally despised, and many hold the view, or at least the wish, that relations between the sides could greatly improve when he is gone. But Shlomo Avineri, a political science professor at Hebrew University, said the departure of Mr. Arafat would not instantly transform the Israeli-Palestinian relationship. ''It's not just a question of Arafat's personality -- this is too simplistic,'' he said. ''I believe there will have to be fundamental changes in Palestinian attitudes, and that is not going to happen overnight, even with a new leadership.''", "title": "Arafat Absent: What to Do In the Interim?"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Israel", "Top/News/World", "Top/News/World/Middle East", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Middle East", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Middle East/Palestinian Authority", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Middle East/Gaza Strip", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Middle East/Israel"], "publication_day_of_month": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "World", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Foreign Desk", "print_page_number": "6", "publication_day_of_week": "Monday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/01/international/middleeast/01mideast.html", "print_column": "3", "slug": "01MIDE$07"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "One of the best indications of President Bush's mood, his aides say, is the degree to which he indulges his boyish humor and enthusiastic impatience. So it was telling, they said, that as he crisscrossed the country in the last few days awaiting the nation's judgment, the candidate who ritually promises to uphold the honor and dignity of his office made a show of goofing around on Air Force One. On Saturday, he was spied near the staff cabin swinging his arms like a samurai warrior with a sword. If the pose left some aides a bit mystified, it also reassured them that Mr. Bush was not only confident of the outcome but was also having a great time in the presidential race's frantic, exhausting final stages. ''He turned to me several days ago and he said, 'Do you think John Kerry's enjoying himself?''' Karen Hughes, Mr. Bush's longtime confidante and communications adviser, said. ''And I was sort of taken aback and I said, 'What do you mean?' And he said, 'Well, I'm really having a good time.' ''He's energized by the people. We're all tired, everybody's tired, we're working long hours. But we're all energized.'' Calculated or genuine, Mr. Bush's playful optimism has become part of his campaign's playbook as he hurtles toward Election Day in a nail-biting position that no incumbent seeking a second term has faced at least since 1948: facing polls that provide no clear evidence of whether, when he wakes up in the White House on Wednesday morning, he will have been rehired, fired or placed in recount limbo. Whatever strain he may be feeling, he betrays none of it in public, no doubt aware, his aides say, that the slightest crack in the facade could dampen turnout among his supporters and the enthusiasm of the hundreds of thousands of volunteers he is calling on to herd them to the polls. People who have spent time with him behind the scenes say the picture is not much different in private. ''It seemed to me that he was very normal, just like when I'd see him in the White House,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who rode across his home state with the president last week. But with the presidency on the line, even some of Mr. Bush's closest family members admit to an extraordinary level of tension, suggesting that the president may not be quite as carefree on the inside as he tries to come across on the outside. His mother, Barbara Bush, made a speech a few days ago in Cleveland and said the closing days of the race were going to be ''terrible'' for her. ''I plan to have a nervous breakdown,'' she said in remarks reported by The Cleveland Plain Dealer. After nearly four years in the White House, leading the nation through trying times and an all-out battle to keep his job, and a campaign he has been waging with ever-increasing intensity for nearly a year and a half, Mr. Bush is showing some wear and tear. He is grayer, and his face is considerably more lined than it was before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He has bags under his eyes, despite his determination to get a good night's sleep (a former baseball team owner and serious fan, he did not stay up to watch the Boston Red Sox, Mr. Kerry's rooting interest, win the World Series on Wednesday night). At 58, Mr. Bush prides himself on having kept himself in good shape; he can no longer run regularly because of bad knees, and his campaign schedule has deprived him of his new favorite form of exercise, long rides on his mountain bike. But when he is on the road he often has an elliptical trainer brought into his room so he can work out. He is appearing at most events now with Laura Bush, and her presence seems to lift his spirits. In Wisconsin on Saturday, he stood beside her on the stage as they were being introduced, gently rubbed her shoulder, reached down to hold her hand and smiled at her. Mr. Bush was traveling with the inner circle that has been with him from the start of his career in elective office: Karl Rove, the strategist whose reputation is on the line; Ms. Hughes, who has shaped his message and public image; Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director; and Joe Hagin, the deputy White House chief of staff. Mr. Bush's brothers Jeb and Marvin were along for part of the day. So was Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, whose presence was a reminder that even at this moment of high political drama, his fate rested to some degree on events in Iraq and the rest of the world. When Mr. Bush arrived Sunday night in Cincinnati, Mr. Rove; Scott McClellan, the press secretary; and other staff members emerged from Air Force One in their Halloween costumes: camouflage outfits, \u00e0 la Kerry. For Mr. Bush and his top aides, it has been a long haul. The president started traveling the country raising money in the middle of last year. He has been mocking and criticizing Mr. Kerry since February, almost from the minute Mr. Kerry became the front-runner for the Democratic Party nomination. He has faced a string of bad news from Iraq, an economy that never generated jobs at the rate he had promised and his own spotty performance in the debates. On the stump, Mr. Bush has had good moments and bad in the campaign's closing days, offering all kinds of opportunity for metaphor but no real insight into what will happen Tuesday. Just about everything went wrong for him on Friday morning in Manchester, N.H. He was supposed to be introduced by the pitcher Curt Schilling, a hero of the World Series sweep by the Red Sox, but Mr. Schilling backed out at the last minute. Mr. Bush was interrupted by protesters holding up a sign referring to the missing explosives in Iraq. As he reached one of the most emotional moments of his speech, canisters of confetti in the rafters above him detonated prematurely in a cackle of gunfire-like explosions, causing him to flinch and forcing him to complete his address in a relentless blizzard of blue and white that accumulated on his hair and suit jacket. But on Friday night, he was greeted rapturously by about 20,000 people in an arena in Columbus, Ohio, in the kind of event that his advance people dream of pulling off. He shared the stage with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, who exhorted the crowd to get out and work ''day and night'' to help Mr. Bush. Mr. Bush is an enthusiastic campaigner who clearly draws energy and strength from the roars of his crowds and the adoring looks of supporters who get to shake his hand or catch his gaze. When they are asked to explain the source of Mr. Bush's confidence, and theirs, his aides point to the deafening reception he gets at his most successful rallies. But Mr. Bush is a hard-headed enough politician not to be totally swayed by anecdotal evidence, especially from rallies at which nearly everyone has been screened to some degree by his campaign or local Republican groups. So in the campaign's waning hours, he gets constant updates on the polls. He has grown so comfortable with the details of polling that it has resulted in a running joke between him and his staff, Ms. Hughes said. After hearing Mr. Bush engage in constant colloquies with Mr. Rove over the merits of voter ''screens,'' the quasi-scientific equations that pollsters use to try to ensure that their results accurately reflect the sentiments of likely voters, Mr. Hagin took action. He recently went to a Home Depot, Ms. Hughes said, bought some window screens, spray painted them with polling jargon like ''R+3'' and presented them to the president aboard Air Force One. Mr. Bush flirted with ending the campaign by shifting to the kind of optimistic, forward-looking oratory that candidates usually turn to at this point. In his speech in Manchester on Friday, he never mentioned Mr. Kerry and spoke in unusually personal terms about how his presidency had affected him. But within hours he was back to his aggressive attacks, portraying the election as a stark choice between security and uncertainty, strength and weakness, principle and expediency. And even as he reaches out to what he calls ''discerning Democrats,'' his campaign is keeping his conservative base stoked. In Wisconsin on Saturday, Mr. Bush urged his supporters to reach across the aisle when they work their precincts on Tuesday. Then he welcomed the presence in the audience of Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, and emphasized that he had ''proudly signed'' the ban on the abortion procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion. Before he went on stage, the country singer Lee Greenwood pumped up the crowd by saying Mr. Bush had ''the right God.'' The pace of his campaigning has picked up noticeably in recent weeks. He will hopscotch through five swing states on Monday before ending the day with a rally in Dallas. After voting in Crawford, Tex., on Tuesday morning, aides said, he may well break with tradition and campaign on Election Day, with several stops en route back to Washington to watch the results at the White House. However it turns out, Ms. Hughes said, Mr. Bush has indicated to her that he will be ''at peace.'' But his assumptions about how it will turn out, she said, do not leave much room for defeat. ''He wants to feel he's done everything possible,'' Ms. Hughes said. ''He's competitive. He wants to be the president for the next four years.''

Shuttling in opposite directions across Ohio and here in Florida, Senator John Kerry and President Bush hopped from church services to outdoor rallies, delivering variations of their messages in an effort to galvanize supporters -- and, perhaps, to win over those last few undecided voters. The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll found that Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry remained locked in a statistical tie. But the poll registered an increase in Mr. Bush's job approval rating, as well as an increase in the number of Americans who said the nation was heading in the right direction. Republicans described this as evidence that Mr. Bush was picking up speed but said that both figures remained dangerously low for an incumbent. The poll also found that voters were concerned about the integrity of the voting system, divided over the legitimacy of Mr. Bush's election four years ago and anxious about the future no matter who won. [Page A16.] In the record advertising war -- totaling an estimated $60 million in the final week, fully one-quarter of all advertising spending in the entire 2000 campaign -- and on the stump, the campaigns put forth their closing arguments, honed and battle-tested over eight long months of campaigning. ''I pledge to you that I will be a president who fights as hard for your jobs as I do for my own,'' Mr. Kerry said in Manchester, N.H., before a crowd of about 10,000, which state Democrats said was a record for a political event. ''We need to lift America up.'' Appearing in Miami, which is heavily Democratic, Mr. Bush made an appeal for support from across the aisle on the basis of his record in battling terrorism. ''If you believe America should fight the war on terror with all her might and lead with unwavering confidence,'' Mr. Bush said, ''I ask you, come stand by me. If you are a Democrat who believes your great party has turned too far left in this year, I ask you, come stand with me.'' Here in Florida and in other swing states, residents were picking through reams of campaign mail as their telephones rang with recorded messages from the likes of former President Bill Clinton and the Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling urging them to vote for Mr. Kerry and Mr. Bush. Airports in swing states were filled with a steady stream of volunteers from uncontested states arriving to knock on doors and make telephone calls to exhort people to vote, all part of a turnout drive that is expected to surpass any other in history. In Ohio alone, the two sides claimed to have more than 150,000 field workers and volunteers who would contact more than one million homes before the polls closed. And in churches, mosques and synagogues, spiritual leaders implored worshipers to vote -- and in some cases were not so subtle in encouraging them to favor one side or the other. After a general election campaign that engaged so extraordinarily early, and never let up, Mr. Bush's closing advertising pitch is similar to his opening one: the world is a dangerous place and the nation's safety cannot be trusted to the liberal likes of Mr. Kerry. As an announcer says in one of Mr. Bush's three closing spots running here, ''Alone in the booth, why take the risk?'' Mr. Kerry's closing argument is the culmination of a several-month search for a clean line of attack: Mr. Bush has made a mess of Iraq, has not done enough to help the middle class find jobs and afford health care, and it is time for a ''fresh start.'' For those worried about Mr. Kerry's ability to protect the nation, he says directly into the camera in one spot running throughout swing states, ''I will stop at nothing to find and kill the terrorists.'' On the trail on Sunday, Mr. Kerry raced from a Baptist church in Dayton, Ohio, to a rally with newly lionized Boston Red Sox executives in downtown Manchester, N.H., to a nighttime event in Tampa, pressing his agenda of job creation, affordable health insurance and improved education as his aides argued that voters were looking for more than just an effective commander in chief. Mr. Kerry tried to focus mainly on domestic issues. He began his day by attending Mass at Holy Angels Catholic Church in Dayton, then crossed town to speak from the pulpit of Shiloh Baptist Church, where he preached a politics of compassion for the needy. ''When you clothe the naked, when you feed the hungry, when you heal the sick, when you visit those in prison,'' he said, quoting Matthew, ''what you do unto the least among us you do unto the Lord himself.'' Mr. Bush, too, went to church. During a service at the Roman Catholic Church of the Epiphany in Miami, Msgr. Jude O'Doherty addressed Mr. Bush, saying, ''Your belief in prayer and dependence on God is an example to all of us,'' according to an account by a pool reporter. To applause from parishioners, the priest thanked Mr. Bush for his ''whole-hearted support of human life'' and for supporting the ''partial-birth abortion'' ban. Mr. Bush appealed to an array of electoral groups as he crisscrossed the state. At a rally in Miami he spoke a few phrases in Spanish and sought to appeal to Cuban-Americans, typically a reliably Republican voting bloc, by reiterating his desire to see Cuba rid itself of Fidel Castro. For the third day, the campaigns and their surrogates debated whether Osama bin Laden's latest taped message effectively punctuated Mr. Bush's overarching message on terrorism or reminded voters of Mr. Kerry's argument that Mr. bin Laden remained missing despite Mr. Bush's earlier pledge to get him ''dead or alive.'' In a transcript of an interview CBS News released Sunday night, Mr. Kerry said, ''I don't think it plays into anybody's hands, and I don't want it to.'' He added: ''How dare Osama bin Laden enter into the election process of the United States of America? I think Americans are smart enough to not let this thug get in the way of decisions that affect health care, schools, jobs, Social Security, Medicare, the future of this country.'' Mr. Bush told Tom Brokaw of NBC News that Mr. bin Laden was ''not going to intimidate or decide this election'' and that ''we are systematically destroying Al Qaeda,'' a theme that his surrogates struck throughout the day. The extraordinarily high advertising spending here and in 11 other swing states comes despite the conventional wisdom that get-out-the-vote efforts matter far more than any paid commercials at the end of a presidential election. But strategists for both campaigns and outside analysts say that with the race so tight neither side can afford to leave any commercial break uncovered as they race to keep their base voters primed while also trying to sway those few stubborn, undecided stragglers. ''If you're voting ultimately on the economy or terrorism or Iraq or health care, these are messages to just reinforce your beliefs,'' said Evan Tracey, chief operating officer of Campaign Media Analysis Group, a Virginia-based firm that tracks advertising and provided the $60 million estimate, which both campaigns affirm. ''Then there are people who connect on the last spot they hear, the last newspaper article they read. In the past those people don't generally matter. But everybody's playing on the margins right now, and they've got to make sure they don't let off the gas at the end.'' Mr. Kerry's media strategists say they planned for this last-minute push months ago, with a deep conviction that Al Gore's depleted war chest in 2000 left him vulnerable in the final days to Mr. Bush, who, they estimate, out-advertised him by some 30 percent, and is the best financed incumbent in history this time around. ''Bush outspent us by $700,000 in the final week and we lost there by 600 votes,'' said Tad Devine, a top strategist for Mr. Kerry, said of Florida. (Mr. Gore actually lost there by 537 votes). ''You don't think maybe I could have found another 600 votes with another $700,000?'' With that in mind, Mr. Devine said the Kerry campaign took a calculated risk to not advertise in August, when it dropped in the polls after coming under heavy attack from Mr. Bush and a group of Swift boat veterans so that it could advertise heavily now. This time in the final days both sides have enough money to advertise just about everywhere they see fit. And while they dispute who is advertising more here and in Ohio, the two sides agree there is no sort of disparity like in 2000. The heaviest advertising war ever -- estimated at more than $550 million since March -- has a downside for the candidates. The airwaves here and elsewhere are so cluttered with commercials that ''it's hard to break through in this climate,'' said Matthew Dowd, Mr. Bush's chief campaign strategist. He said Mr. Bush's now well-known ''wolves spot'' featuring a pack of wolves prowling a forest as an announcer warns ''weakness attracts those who are waiting to do America harm'' was devised to stand out in the crowd. Mr. Kerry's strategists said their spots stood out by primarily featuring Mr. Kerry speaking directly into the camera in a way that Mr. Bush -- whose aides acknowledge that he is not as smooth a speaker as Mr. Kerry is -- has not done during the election. But the campaigns have stiff competition from outside groups. The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth are running a final couple of spots once again accusing Mr. Kerry of betraying his fellow soldiers when he came back from fighting in Vietnam to speak out against the war in the early 1970's. The Media Fund, a Democratic group, is running advertisements in several states raising questions about Mr. Bush's relationship with the ''corrupt'' Saudi royal family, which the group's president, Erik Smith, described as ''magic'' because ''it speaks to the base and independents.''

The company, despite its popularity with consumers, has grown accustomed to being accused of crushing Main Street merchants with its sprawling stores and low prices and of driving down wages for workers across the retail industry. And more than a million former and current female Wal-Mart employees are part of a sex discrimination lawsuit that the company is fighting. Now, Wal-Mart finds itself under attack for what critics see as its miserly approach to employee health care, which they say is forcing too many of its workers and their families into state insurance programs or making them rely on charity care by hospitals. Wal-Mart vigorously defends its health care policies, saying it offers affordable coverage for all employees. The company says it has no way of knowing how many of its employees, whom it calls associates, or their families are insured under state programs. The larger issue of whether companies can and should absorb the soaring cost of health care is a national issue, said Susan Chambers, the executive vice president who oversees benefits at Wal-Mart. ''You can't solve it for the 1.2 million associates if you can't solve it for the country.'' A survey by Georgia officials found that more than 10,000 children of Wal-Mart employees were in the state's health program for children at an annual cost of nearly $10 million to taxpayers. A North Carolina hospital found that 31 percent of 1,900 patients who described themselves as Wal-Mart employees were on Medicaid, while an additional 16 percent had no insurance at all. And backers of a measure that will be on California's ballot tomorrow, which would force big employers like Wal-Mart to either provide affordable health insurance to their workers or pay into a state insurance pool, say Wal-Mart employees without company insurance are costing California's state health care programs an estimated $32 million a year. Meanwhile, in Washington State, where the insurance commissioner is pushing the legislature to adopt a law similar to the one on the California ballot, companies that struggle to compete with Wal-Mart while insuring most of their own workers have become openly critical. ''Socially, we're engaged in a race to the bottom,'' said Craig Cole, the chief executive of Brown & Cole Stores, a supermarket chain that employs about 2,000 workers in Washington and adjoining states and pays for insurance coverage for about 95 percent of its employees. ''Do we want to allow competition based on exploitation of the work force?'' he asked. Wal-Mart, which disputes the California figures and says it cannot verify the Georgia and North Carolina data, says its employees are largely insured. It cites internal surveys indicating that 90 percent of its employees have insurance -- many through means other than Wal-Mart's coverage because they are senior citizens on Medicare, students covered by their parents' policies or employees with second jobs or working spouses. ''We are doing everything we can to take care of our associates and not shift costs,'' Ms. Chambers said. The company has gone on its own offensive, saying last week that it was spending $500,000 to defeat the California measure, Proposition 72. The measure is opposed by many other businesses, particularly restaurants and retailers, and by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who asserts that it would impede the state's economic recovery and lead to a loss of jobs. Wal-Mart has also been running a television ad nationally that features a Wal-Mart worker whose company health insurance covered his toddler son's treatments for life-threatening liver disease. ''Without Wal-Mart,'' the father says, ''I don't know that he would have made it.'' But critics say the reality for too many Wal-Mart workers and their families is no insurance -- either because they are unable to meet the company's eligibility requirements or because they cannot afford monthly premiums as high as $264 a month for family coverage on an $8-an-hour cashier's wage. Wal-Mart says its employees make $10 an hour on average. Countering Wal-Mart's television ad, a California group supporting Proposition 72 has begun publicizing the case of a former Wal-Mart employee, Marco Guillen, who says he twice missed the company's annual enrollment deadline for health insurance. The first time, he said, was because he was confused about his eligibility. The second time, he said, was because he was in a coma after being in a car accident. His medical bills were about $1 million, he said, and were paid by the state's Medi-Cal version of Medicaid. Wal-Mart declined to discuss the specifics of the case, saying that doing so would violate Mr. Guillen's rights under the federal laws governing patient privacy. The company says it spent about $1.3 billion of its $256 billion in revenue last year on employee health care to insure about 537,000 people, or about 45 percent of its work force. Wal-Mart says that 23 percent of its employees are not eligible for coverage, but that it covers 58 percent of those who are. That compares with an insured rate of 96 percent of eligible full-time or part-time employees of Costco Wholesale, the discount retailer that is Wal-Mart's closest competitor nationwide. Costco employees -- most of whom are not represented by a union -- become eligible for health insurance after three months working full time, or six months part time. At Wal-Mart, which has no union employees, many who work full time must wait six months to become eligible. Part-time workers are not eligible for at least two years. Because of turnover, some employees never work long enough to become eligible. If there is any place where Wal-Mart's labor costs find support, it is Wall Street, where Costco has taken a drubbing from analysts who say its labor costs are too high. Costco's pretax profit margin is only 2.7 percent of revenue, less than half Wal-Mart's margin of 5.5 percent. Wal-Mart now asks employees to pay 33 percent of the company's cost of providing insurance, but says it plans to reduce that to 30 percent. So far, Costco has resisted pressure to increase employees' share of health care premiums beyond a planned target of 8 percent in 2007, reasoning that too many of their workers would be forced to drop coverage. ''From the very beginning of time, the founders here felt you have to pay a living wage and provide benefits,'' said Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer of Costco, which is based in Issaquah, Wash. Wal-Mart finds itself up against a national tradition of providing health insurance to workers that took root during World War II, when wages were frozen and many companies offered health benefits in lieu of higher pay. After the war, unions at many big manufacturers also demanded generous benefits, and workers of all stripes throughout corporate America came to expect health insurance as a right of employment. But in recent years, as global competition has become more intense, as organized labor has lost some of its clout and as medical costs have spiraled upward, employers have become increasingly unwilling to shoulder the cost of coverage. In 1987, only a quarter of the people working for large companies did not have insurance. By 2001, that figure had increased to about a third, according to a recent study by the Commonwealth Fund, a New York nonprofit group dedicated to health care research. Industry experts assume the percentage of working uninsured has continued to grow. Other data indicate that of the 45 million people without health insurance in this country, nearly 70 percent are working full time or are the dependents of full-time workers. Wal-Mart's rise to become the nation's biggest employer and largest retailer also speaks to a larger shift in the economy in the last generation, as a growing proportion of jobs shifted to service industries. Wal-Mart has succeeded because tens of millions of shoppers around the country flock to its stores for its sharply discounted prices. That business model, which is being widely imitated, depends on low-cost labor. But government officials in various states, as well as some other employers, say Wal-Mart should nevertheless share more of the financial burden of its workers' health care. ''The Wal-Mart executives chose to remove the responsibility from themselves,'' said Mike Kreidler, the insurance commissioner for Washington State, who is pushing for a law requiring employers to provide insurance coverage either directly or indirectly. Although Wal-Mart officials flatly deny it, some Wal-Mart employees say they are encouraged to turn to public health care assistance. When Wal-Mart hired Samantha Caizza, a single mother of three, as a cashier at its Chehalis, Wash., store last November, she says she was told by a personnel manager ''to get ahold of the state'' for coverage for her children. Unlike many Wal-Mart workers, Ms. Caizza was willing to talk to a reporter about her experience because she was fired in June -- for reasons she said had to do with union organizing activities. Wal-Mart said it could not comment on her case. The company hands out instructions to its employees to help them to apply to social service agencies, which Wal-Mart says is simply part of the service they provide employees who need to have their income verified for any number of reasons. Many employees say they simply cannot afford the health plans being offered. Ms. Caizza, for example, worked about 32 hours a week, making $8 an hour. Full-time employees make about $1,200 a month on those wages, meaning the $133 to $264 they are asked to pay for family coverage may not be within their reach. And even the cheapest plans come with a hefty out-of-pocket price for employees, where they may be on the hook for as much as $13,000 in medical costs for their families. ''While I was working there, I couldn't afford it for my children,'' said Beverly Winston, another former employee, who says she turned to state-subsidized coverage for her children while working at Wal-Mart in Renton, Wash., in the late 1990's. Ms. Winston is among the group of women around the nation now suing the company for sex discrimination. ''We work very hard for that to be affordable,'' said Ms. Chambers, the Wal-Mart executive, who said she thought the prices for the least expensive plans were ''a very reasonable opening-price point.'' With the number of uninsured people in Washington climbing -- now slightly more than a half-million people, or 9.4 percent of the population by one estimate -- the state is grappling with the rising costs of caring for them. ''The problem is getting much worse,'' said Mr. Kreidler, who says the cost of caring for the uninsured in Washington now approaches $400 million a year. Asking the hospitals to keep paying the rising cost of the uninsured is not a solution, Mr. Kreidler said. But Wal-Mart says it is not reasonable to ask companies like it to solve the problems of the uninsured and the escalating cost of medical care. It needs to be ''part of a national debate,'' Ms. Chambers said.", "title": "States Are Battling Against Wal-Mart Over Health Care"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/U.S.", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/California", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Georgia", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Washington", "Top/News/U.S./Northwest", "Top/News/U.S./South", "Top/News/U.S./West", "Top/News", "Top/News/Health", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Banking, Finance and Insurance", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Healthcare", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Medicine and Health", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Activities and Interests/Shopping", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Retail", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Health Insurance and Managed Care", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Georgia", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Washington", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/California", "Top/News/Front Page"], "publication_day_of_month": "1", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Front Page; Health; U.S.", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "National Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Monday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/01/business/01health.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "01HEAL$07"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Stuffed into a hotel elevator in the first hours of Saturday morning, Senator John Kerry put his loyal and long-suffering press secretary, David Wade, in a mock headlock, then swatted him in the back of the head. ''Not bad for 30 points down in New Hampshire, eh?'' Mr. Wade recalled Mr. Kerry saying. A year ago, as former President Bill Clinton said as he stood by his side last week before some 100,000 fans in Philadelphia, Mr. Kerry's quest for even the Democratic nomination seemed ''dead as a doornail.'' Now he is in a dead heat for the big prize. His desperate ditching of his campaign manager and mortgaging his house to reverse seemingly impossible odds in this state's early primary are but a bad dream. On the final hill of this roller-coaster campaign, Mr. Kerry has been relaxed and playful yet workmanlike and focused, visibly weary -- and hopelessly superstitious. This looser, more jovial Mr. Kerry, even as some around him show their increasing stress, replaces the brooding, super-serious persona he has displayed on the campaign trail for much of the year. Behind the curtain of his airplane cabin, Mr. Kerry and some of his closest friends wound their way through the Indiana Jones trilogy on DVD. The other morning in Wisconsin, he summoned the campaign photographer to capture his sober strategist, Bob Shrum, wearing a puffy yellow foam cheesehead. Between Catholic Mass and Baptist church on Sunday morning in Ohio, he stopped his motorcade to toss a football with his former brother-in-law, David Thorne. He has jumped into the shower ahead of his wake-up calls, cut back on his telephone chats with an endless circles of advisers and, mostly, delivered the new lines in his stripped-down stump speech with determination. He knew instantly he wanted to make a statement of unity upon the emergence of a videotape from Osama bin Laden on Friday afternoon, and strode purposefully, alone, across the tarmac in West Palm Beach, Fla., to do so. But as shadows settle under his eyes, he has sapped the energy of some crowds with his less-than-spellbinding ways, and made more than a few slips: cheering the University of Wisconsin Badgers while in the neighboring swing state of Iowa, and repeatedly referring to a Cleveland company as making ''wire paper,'' rather than wire hangers. With a four-leaf clover he got before his stunning comeback in the Iowa caucuses in one pocket, and an Ohio buckeye someone gave him when he became the Democratic standard-bearer in the other, Mr. Kerry is taking no chances. Just look at the Boston Red Sox cap on the curly brown hair of Josh Gottheimer, his New York-bred speechwriter. Landing on the wrong side of a bet during the American League Championship Series, Mr. Gottheimer, a Yankees lover, was to wear the loathed hat all day on Oct. 21, but now his boss will not let him take it off. Aides said that Mr. Kerry also turned from the television when any polls, like the ones this weekend showing President Bush edging ahead, flashed across CNN, and had refused to discuss a potential transition or even victory or concession speeches for Tuesday night. ''It's part superstition, it's also part just discipline,'' said one senior staff member. ''If we seem to get excited about something, he'll say, 'No, it's a poll, it doesn't matter. Keep your eyes on the prize.' He says a lot, 'All you can do is win every day, don't get ahead of yourself.''' Mr. Kerry, 60, has been at this now for nearly two full years -- or, depending how you look at it, since his Yale classmates teased him by playing ''Hail to the Chief'' on kazoos whenever he entered the room. There is a calm confidence about him in these closing days, as if he buys into his lectures to supporters that this ''most important election of our lifetime'' is now in their hands. He increasingly speaks of things -- a hunting trip in an Ohio cornfield where he ''bagged a few geese,'' American democracy itself -- as ''blessings,'' and has been sharing more personal stories on the stump. In Reno, Nev., he told of knocking on doors with his sister Peggy for Adlai Stevenson in 1952. In Madison, Wis., Columbus, Ohio, and Miami he mentioned taking his daughters to their first concert, on Bruce Springsteen's ''Born in the USA'' tour. Those closest to him say he has been genuinely moved by the huge crowds at his stops, the voters he meets, and the political and cultural heroes -- Mr. Clinton, Mr. Springsteen, the former astronaut and Ohio senator John Glenn -- introducing him each day. ''He loved what Bruce said, the words that Bruce spoke about John Kerry,'' Stephanie Cutter, the communications director, said of Mr. Springsteen's poetic tribute. ''He asked for a copy of Bruce's remarks, he has it with him, he keeps reading it over and over. He keeps saying to me, 'This is good, isn't it?''' Mr. Kerry has been buoyed these past two weeks by the history-making come-from-behind success of his hometown team, hopping up to the cockpit for score updates as he flitted from one swing state to another. He spent 10 minutes throwing a baseball last Saturday on the tarmac in Pueblo, Colo., with his 27-year-old daughter, Vanessa, patiently coaching her as she tottered on spike heels. Upon the final World Series out on Wednesday night, he bolted from his hotel suite in Toledo, Ohio, yelling down the hall to aides working in an adjacent room, ''Sox win! World Champs!'' He called his brother Cameron for a postgame debrief and, before going to bed, told his trip director, Setti Warren, ''We have five games left of our own.'' Ms. Kerry said her perennial phone tag with her father this week had been at once parochial and poignant. He left a sympathy message on Tuesday when he learned she had a root canal. Another night, she said, he wondered, ''Do you know why I want to be president of the United States?'' ''I was like no, Pappy, why, I know why, but I like to hear those answers,'' Ms. Kerry recalled, adding that this time he said it was to pacify the Middle East. ''He's more focused. The little things that used to bother him, he doesn't even mention any more. He's given up his exercise. He used to complain about that; I haven't heard him complain about that. He knows this long journey's almost over.'' The other day at the front of the plane, Mr. Kerry was staring at a briefing book, trying to sound out a complicated name on his thank-you list. ''Lower down on the page it had the pronunciation,'' Ms. Kerry recalled. ''I just happened to see it before him and I pointed it out to him, and he said, 'You insolent child,' and we just started laughing. ''Five minutes later I said, 'Hey Dad,' and I pointed, and I did the hand gestures he does on stage, and he recognized it, and he absolutely cracked up laughing, to the point where he couldn't breathe.'' Besides his two daughters, who have each spent a couple of the final days with him before heading out to campaign solo, Mr. Kerry has taken some confidants aboard his chartered Boeing 757 to play cards, watch movies like ''Caddyshack'' and ''Lord of the Rings,'' or listen as he strums his Spanish classical guitar. Two friends of his wife's, Ron Davenport, who runs the black radio network Sheridan Broadcasting, and Ari Kopelman, the chief executive of Chanel, have been on the plane, along with Dan Barbiero, Mr. Kerry's prep school and college roommate, and his first wife's brother, Mr. Thorne. On Friday in Orlando, he introduced his Navy crewmate, Del Sandusky, with the most intimate words he had perhaps ever spoken publicly about his time in Vietnam, recalling their tour on a 50-foot boat ''with a lot of guns and a lot of people.'' ''He was responsible for moving that boat in the direction we wanted; he had two throttles and a steering wheel, and sometimes he held onto those plenty tight, because that's all he had to hang onto, that and his faith in God,'' Mr. Kerry told his audience. ''We would not be here today, either of us, were it not for his courage or his skill or his unfailing ability to follow orders instantaneously immediately. Even when I said that we're going into that ambush, or turn to the right, we're going straight ahead right into it, he just turned that boat we went straight into it.'' The next morning in Appleton, Wis., the day dawned cold and the dark sky threatened rain, and campaign aides were brainstorming how to keep Mr. Kerry's cue cards dry. ''He was very excited, he said, 'I have a great idea: plastic sheets!''' Mr. Wade, the press secretary, said later. ''It was as if he discovered electricity.'' As he boarded his plane here for a last flight to Florida on Sunday evening, Mr. Kerry smiled at the spectacle of the flight attendants decked out in orange feather boas and fluffy cat's ears for Halloween. Asked what he was dressed as, Mr. Kerry, his tie loose and his trademark mustard-colored barn jacket over a suit coat, said, ''My costume is future president.''

In Baghdad, South Koreans plan to open a seminary even after Iraqi churches have been bombed in two recent coordinated attacks. In Beijing, they defy the Chinese government to smuggle North Koreans to Seoul while turning them into Christians. South Korea has rapidly become the world's second largest source of Christian missionaries, only a couple of decades after it started deploying them. With more than 12,000 abroad, it is second only to the United States and ahead of Britain. The Koreans have joined their Western counterparts in more than 160 countries, from the Middle East to Africa, from Central to East Asia. Imbued with the fervor of the born again, they have become known for aggressively going to -- and sometimes being expelled from -- the hardest-to-evangelize corners of the world. Their actions are at odds with the foreign policy of South Korea's government, which is trying to rein them in here and elsewhere. It is the first time that large numbers of Christian missionaries have been deployed by a non-Western nation, one whose roots are Confucian and Buddhist, and whose population remains two-thirds non-Christian. Unlike Western missionaries, whose work dovetailed with the spread of colonialism, South Koreans come from a country with little history of sending people abroad until recently. They proselytize, not in their own language, but in the local one or English. ''There is a saying that when Koreans now arrive in a new place, they establish a church; the Chinese establish a restaurant; the Japanese, a factory,'' said a South Korean missionary in his 40's, who has worked here for several years and, like many others, asked not to be identified because of the dangers of proselytizing in Muslim countries. In Iraq, eight South Korean missionaries were briefly kidnapped in April. Then, in June, Kim Sun Il, a 33-year-old man who had planned to do missionary work, was taken hostage and beheaded. In July, nearly 460 North Korean defectors arrived in South Korea, thanks to a smuggling network set up by missionaries in China. In 1979, only 93 South Koreans were serving as missionaries, according to the Korea Research Institute for Missions. Compared with South Korea's 12,000, there are about 46,000 American and 6,000 British missionaries, according to missionary organizations in South Korea and the West. Roman Catholicism first came to the Korean Peninsula in the late 18th century, followed a century later by Protestant missionaries from the United States. Christianity failed to set firm roots in Japan and China, where 19th-century missionaries were seen as agents of Western imperialism. But it spread quickly on the Korean Peninsula, where American missionaries helped Korean nationalists fight against Japanese colonial rulers and informed the outside world of the brutalities of Japanese colonialism. It was only in the last two decades, however, with the growth of the South Korean economy and its newly democratic government's decision to allow its citizens to travel freely overseas, that South Korean Christianity took on a missionary gloss. Today, an equal number of missionaries are born again or members of Presbyterian, Methodist and Baptists denominations, said Steve S.C. Moon, executive director of the Korea Research Institute for Missions. These missionaries, like their Western counterparts, tend to focus on activities that are evangelical, educational and medical, and their beliefs are far more traditional than those of newer sects like the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, the Korean-rooted movement. A typical case is the Presbyterian Onnuri Church, founded 19 years ago with the main purpose of training missionaries. It now has 500 in 53 countries, though it focuses on China, Indonesia and India, said Kim Joong Won, director of its missionary program. Until June, Onnuri had a church in Baghdad where Kim Sun Il, who was beheaded, had gone to worship. ''He is a martyr to God's glory,'' said Mr. Moon of the research institute. ''Korean missionaries are eager to do God's work and glorify God. They want to die for God.'' Because religious visas are difficult to obtain in the Middle East, many come on student visas or set up computer or other businesses, and evangelize discreetly. One Korean who has worked here several years and spoke of evangelizing in a ''low voice and with wisdom,'' said that over intimate meals with three or four Muslims he would let the conversation drift to Jesus. So delicate is his work that he never mentions words like ''missionary'' or ''evangelize.'' Muslims who have converted to Christianity are never identified as such -- a necessary precaution in a society where some families engage in so-called honor killings of relatives who have left Islam. Many missionaries also focus on bringing Arab Catholics or Chaldeans into the evangelical fold. ''There are so many ways to do our work,'' said the missionary in his 40's, who works in a local church in Amman and delivers English sermons that are translated into Arabic. ''Just as American missionaries did in Korea by building schools and hospitals, there are many ways here,'' he said. ''One important group is Iraqi refugees. They come here. They are tired physically and spiritually. They are so lonely. We help them. They realize they are being helped by Christians. Then they ask about Jesus.'' About 30 missionary families have settled here in Amman. Others wait to return to Iraq, which they left in June under intense pressure from the South Korean government. John Jung has been working with an Iraqi pastor, Estawri Haritounian, 40, to open a seminary at the National Protestant Evangelical Church in Baghdad. ''Saddam Hussein's regime allowed Christians to gather in private houses, so it was difficult, though possible, for us to evangelize,'' said Mr. Jung, who has been traveling in and out of Iraq for several years. ''But now it has become even more difficult for Christians in Iraq. Christians are afraid of Muslims for the first time. We are frustrated we can't be in Iraq at this important time. But as soon as the security allows, we will go back to Baghdad.'' In Baghdad, Mr. Haritounian explained recently that the church had been founded half a century ago with the help of British missionaries. American missionaries replaced them later and were in turn succeeded by South Koreans. ''We dreamed this dream, Pastor John and I, to start a seminary in Baghdad,'' said Mr. Haritounian, showing eight completed, though empty, classrooms. Mr. Jung, in Amman, said they hoped to start classes as soon as the security improved in Baghdad. ''We'll start with only 15 students, but we hope to grow in the future,'' he said. Many in Amman said South Koreans had an advantage over others, especially now that the war in Iraq has aggravated anti-American feelings in the Middle East. ''People expect missionaries to be from America or Europe, so Koreans can do their work quietly,'' Mr. Haritounian said. ''Because of the bad image of Americans now, it will be more difficult for American missionaries to work here.'' Dennis Merdian, 50, an American missionary, said that in one difficult project he and a South Korean counterpart agreed immediately that it would be better for the South Korean to take the lead. ''He wasn't carrying the American government with him,'' Mr. Merdian said. But because of their short history of living overseas, some South Koreans expect that other cultures will behave the same way their own does and that Christianity will spread abroad as quickly as it did in South Korea, said Mr. Moon of the Korea Research Institute for Missions. ''Western missionaries tend to carry a sense of guilt because of their imperialist past,'' he said. ''But Koreans don't have that historical baggage, and they are not inhibited in reaching out to people with the Gospel. So in their missionary work, they tend not to consult the local people, but make decisions in one direction.'' Shadi Samir, 28, a Jordanian pastor who has worked with South Koreans and recently visited Seoul, said he had seen inexperienced missionaries commit cultural blunders. ''They come here full of energy and go out on the streets where they approach women and tell them Jesus loves them,'' Mr. Samir said. ''By making such mistakes, they create problems not only for themselves and other Koreans, but also for us.'' Kim Dong Moon, a missionary who works in the Middle East and also writes about the missionary movement, said some South Korean missionaries had been deported from the Middle East and ended up on blacklists. ''There are some pushy Korean missionaries whose approach is: 'Come to the Kingdom of God now! Or, go to hell,''' Mr. Kim said recently in Seoul. In China, South Koreans concentrate on converting the Chinese, as well as the ethnic North Koreans living in northeastern China. After they are smuggled out of China to South Korea, though, only about a third of the North Koreans continue practicing Christianity, missionaries said. Other South Koreans train North Korean Christians to return to the North to spread the Gospel. ''North Korea, which is occupied by the devil Kim Jong Il, is the biggest target of our missionary work,'' said Kim Sang Chul, president of the Commission to Help North Korean Refugees, a Christian organization. The missionary here in Amman in his 40's said that, in his previous posting in the Philippines, he was awed when he saw American missionaries fly to remote islands and, wherever they spotted signs of life in the jungle below, drop food packets as the first contact with what missionaries call ''unreached people.'' ''So even here, it is very difficult, but not impossible,'' he said. ''We are planting one church at a time.''

When the lights come up on Dix, the disillusioned half of the pair, he is sporting facial hair and a wiseacre delivery. And when Jack, the man of faith, appears, he has unshakable convictions and a Southern accent. Ah, the blissful, lazy world of theatrical shorthand, where all cynics are bearded and all conservative Christians are doctrinaire and from below the Mason-Dixon line. The two men, brothers-in-law, have been visited by extreme tragedy, though to say more would be to severely undercut the first act, a collection of fragmentary dialogue that seeks to get you guessing about who's who and what has happened but mostly is just annoying. Jack (John Jimerson) and Dix (Joe Thompson), polar opposites in good Theater 101 fashion, are coping with loss, each in his own way, Jack proclaiming his faith in Jesus, Dix getting rid of clothing and furniture and house and anything else that might remind him of happier days. Mr. Rawlings tries to work this into a pithy discussion of faith and fate and why God, if there is a God, lets bad things happen. But he doesn't have much new to offer on these ageless questions, especially not in a city that has been pondering them, with far more nuance, since Sept. 11, 2001. That's not to say that it is without compelling notions. A few stretches where Jack confronts the realization that you can't force faith or friendship onto someone who doesn't want it are nicely rendered and acted. So is a moment when Jack briefly comes face-to-face with the possibility that faith can only take you so far, an idea from which he quickly retreats. ''We have got to endure this without trying to understand,'' he says, a starkly eloquent admission that may have been the bottom line for many New Yorkers.

But other pyrotechnics were going off in a distant corner, where a giant scrum of reporters ignored the candidate but hung on to every word of a bombastic, deceptively cherub-faced man Democrats love to hate. He was Karl Rove, the president's political adviser, the man who devised the strategy of playing hard to Mr. Bush's conservative base. On Nov. 3, depending on the outcome, Mr. Rove will be either a genius or a goat. It is hard to know what Mr. Rove has been feeling inside, but in the waning days of his toughest political fight he is suddenly turning up at campaign stops to push his sunny version of events on reporters, who rush to him like ducks seeking a crumb of bread in a pond. Almost nobody knows if Mr. Rove's cheery mood means he is convinced from the campaign's polling that Mr. Bush will win, or whether it is a front to try to put a positive spin on a bad turn of events. Either way, it was Mr. Rove who said four years ago that Mr. Bush would easily beat Al Gore in the Electoral College, a prediction that reporters like to bring up to torture him. Someone dutifully mentioned it in the press scrum in the pasture. ''Rub my nose in it,'' Mr. Rove shot back. With a circle of tape recorders humming, Mr. Rove said he was making no such predictions this time around. But that did not stop him from asserting that the campaign's nightly polls showed Mr. Bush even with or ahead of Senator John Kerry in 8 of 10 battleground states, and that it was wrong to assume that undecided voters would in the end support the challenger. ''I can tell you this: The undecideds are more likely to be conservative and moderate than they are liberal,'' Mr. Rove said. ''They're virtually all white, they're more women than men, they're more churchgoing than not churchgoing, and the president's job approval among those people is 49 or 50 almost every night and by a margin of 18 points they think the president is going to win. They're the traditional undecided voter who is paying some attention but not taking a lot in and is going to make a late decision, and all the factors in the poll lead me to believe that they will break our way.'' Mr. Rove was even more assured about Mr. Bush's prospects in Arkansas, where a recent poll showed Mr. Kerry pulling even with the president and where both sides are spending money on a late advertising push. Asked if he saw a difference in the president's poll numbers in the state, Mr. Rove said no and then gleefully insisted that the Republicans had made the Democrats spend money there. ''We've succeeded in suckering them,'' he said. ''We've got a little extra cash on the table, so we're going to go down there and just taunt them a little bit.'' It is Mr. Rove who delivers all polling news to the president, as he did with the results of the latest Newsweek survey on Saturday aboard Air Force One. ''Sir, Newsweek has you up six,'' Mr. Rove told Mr. Bush, according to Karen Hughes, a top Bush adviser. Typically, Mr. Rove and Mr. Bush will then get into an intricate discussion of the method the poll used to screen for likely voters and ''all this mumbo jumbo,'' Ms. Hughes said. Other times Mr. Rove likes to playfully withhold news of recent polls from the president. ''He'll smile and say, 'I'm not going to tell you about the latest numbers,' but he'll have a big smile on his face,'' Ms. Hughes said. Mr. Rove seemed in a good mood even at a small disaster of a rally on Friday morning in Manchester, N.H., where Curt Schilling, the star Red Sox pitcher, failed to turn up as promised and balloons prematurely popped in the ceiling, sending a shower of confetti in Mr. Bush's face at a serious moment in his speech. Mr. Rove, who is the chief suspect among Internet conspiracy theorists and some Democrats who claim Mr. Bush received answers in the presidential debates via a hidden earpiece, stood on the sidelines in Manchester happily checking his BlackBerry. At one point his mood was so festive that he even cupped his hand over his mouth and pretended to be transmitting lines to the president. ''Terrorist networks around the world,'' Mr. Rove intoned, as if he were sending instructions to Mr. Bush. ''We will confront them and stay on the offensive.'' Now, with only 24 hours until the election (and assuming no deadlock), Mr. Rove will soon know whether he can light a cigar with Mr. Bush or start looking for a new job. On Thursday night in the Pennsylvania pasture, Mr. Rove was asked how he was feeling. ''I'm feeling good,'' he said. ''I'm feeling very good.'' Did it worry him that he was feeling good? ''It does sometimes,'' Mr. Rove acknowledged. ''Particularly about 3:30 in the morning.''

The attack came as Prime Minister Ayad Allawi issued repeated warnings that negotiations with the rebels holding another Iraqi town, Falluja, were swiftly running out of time and that an assault to retake the territory was imminent. The rocket attack, about 7:50 p.m., struck a hotel where itinerant Shiite workers often stay, a new Iraqi satellite television channel, Al Sharqiya, quoted a local police chief as saying. Tikrit, about 100 miles north of Baghdad, is Saddam Hussein's hometown and is dominated by Sunni Muslims. The rocket, which struck the second story of the hotel, was one of two fired by insurgents, said Master Sgt. Robert Cowens, a spokesman for the United States Army's First Infantry Division. The second landed harmlessly, he said. On Monday morning, the deputy governor of Baghdad was assassinated when unidentified gunmen fired on his convoy in the capital's southern district of Dura, the Interior Ministry said. The deputy governor, Hatim Kamil Abdul Fattah, was fatally shot, as were two of his four bodyguards, said the ministry spokesman, Col. Adnan Abdul Rahman. In a meeting with reporters on Sunday, Dr. Allawi said that unless his government was allowed to establish control of Falluja immediately, he would ask the American and Iraqi forces massed around the town to attack. Dr. Allawi said that as recently as Saturday night he had met with tribal and religious leaders from Falluja and nearby Ramadi, where clashes broke out early Sunday between insurgents and United States marines. But there was little sign of any progress, and the prime minister made it clear that chances for a peaceful settlement were rapidly fading. ''The time is closing down, really,'' Dr. Allawi said. ''I am not putting a time schedule, but we are approaching the end.'' An Army spokesman for the Second Brigade Combat Team in Ramadi said that one marine had been killed and four had been wounded when a roadside bomb went off during a patrol in Ramadi on Sunday. The spokesman had no information about any civilian causalities. The spokesman also said that on Saturday, two Iraqis were killed and four were wounded when an armored personnel carrier shot at a suspected suicide car bomb that turned out to be a taxi with six apparently innocent people inside. The incident occurred at a vehicle control point. A preliminary investigation found no explosives in the car, the spokesman said. He added that the episode was ''a very unfortunate, very tragic event, and we hate it when these kinds of things happen.'' ''We have had six suicide bombs in the last week against our units,'' said the spokesman. ''At least one of them was a taxi, so you could understand the soldier's actions. He fired first at the engine block, but it continued to accelerate so the second time he shot into the cab, killing the driver.'' In a meeting with reporters inside the heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad, Dr. Allawi ticked off what he said were recent successes in killing and capturing insurgents and their leaders in Iraq. He emphasized the capture of what he said were 167 fighters who had come from outside Iraq, but it was unclear whether they had come to the country recently to fight or had immigrated years ago. He was unambiguous about his motivations in the gathering storm around Falluja. ''The terrorists and insurgents continue to use Falluja and the people of Falluja as a shield,'' Dr. Allawi said, giving a list of recent insurgent attacks. ''That's why I cannot stand back and allow such attacks to continue.'' Dr. Allawi said that he would keep pressing for a peaceful resolution but that ''our patience is running thin.'' Dr. Allawi declined to say much about something that has received intense discussion in the American presidential campaign in the past week -- the disappearance of hundreds of tons of powerful conventional explosives from Al Qaqaa, a weapons site south of Baghdad, around the time of the invasion of the country last year. ''I don't like to really have a premature comment,'' Dr. Allawi said, adding that he had ordered the ''relevant authorities'' to start an investigation.

The study, published in the October issue of The American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, found that the brain injury that leads to cerebral palsy was much more commonly associated with infection than with hypoxia. The new findings, said Dr. Ernest Graham, an assistant professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Johns Hopkins and the lead author of the study, have important implications for both research and clinical practice. ''This changes our thinking,'' Dr. Graham said. ''In the past, we've focused primarily on hypoxia,'' but the study suggests that monitoring for hypoxia ''isn't likely to help very much.'' Finding ways to prevent and treat infections, on the other hand, ''may have a huge impact on the problem,'' he said. The researchers studied premature infants born from 1994 to 2001 in a university hospital. They looked at cases of periventricular leukomalacia, or PVL, a specific kind of damage to the white matter of the brain. The white matter transmits signals in the brain and from the brain to the spinal cord, and is particularly subject to injury in premature infants. While there are other factors associated with brain damage in premature infants, like bleeding into the brain and pregnancies in which a woman carries two or more fetuses, a large majority of infants with PVL develop cerebral palsy. The symptoms may not be evident for many months after birth, but the damage can be seen on brain scans, which reveal the characteristic cysts that form after brain tissue is damaged. In time, the cysts are reabsorbed, leaving abnormally enlarged ventricles where the brain tissue has died. PVL can cause a range of physical and mental disabilities from mild to very severe, but the most common is spastic diplegia, tightly contracted muscles in the legs that cannot function normally. When researchers looked at 150 preterm babies with PVL and matched them to a control group of 150 preemies born in the same time period who did not have brain damage, the results were surprising. Hypoxia, as measured by umbilical cord blood tests, was no more common in the premature babies with PVL than it was in the other babies. Delivery by Caesarean section was not associated with PVL, nor did tests of blood chemistry distinguish injured from noninjured babies. Even babies whose fetal heart rates were reduced during labor and delivery were not any more likely than other babies to suffer brain injury. What did make a difference, and it was a large one, was whether the babies had suffered infections. Infants who had positive bacterial cultures of the blood, cerebrospinal fluid or throat were two to four times as likely to suffer brain damage as those who did not. Staphylococcus infections predominated, but the researchers found more than 10 other kinds of infections as well, and the type of infection made no difference in the rates of injury. ''This is an important and fascinating paper,'' said Dr. Larry Gilstrap, chairman of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston. Dr. Gilstrap, who was not involved in the study, noted that with a possible cause for the brain injuries, methods of preventing them might be found.", "title": "New Evidence on Main Cause of Cerebral Palsy"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/Health", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Cerebral Palsy", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Pregnancy"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Health", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Health & Fitness", "print_page_number": "14", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "F", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/science/02infa.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "02INFA$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "After the Cassini spacecraft's close-up photography and radar imaging of Saturn's largest moon, the first parting of its veil of dense smog, scientists know this much for sure about Titan: it is one of the strangest worlds in the solar system. ''Most of what we see is very alien,'' said Dr. Laurence A. Soderblom, a planetary scientist with the United States Geological Survey. The surface of Titan seen so far is a mosaic of bright, or rugged, regions bordering dark expanses where the terrain is generally smooth and may include lakes of liquid methane and ethane. One such ''lake'' appears to be as large as Lake Champlain. Some places resemble a cracked eggshell, with thin bright threads running like fissures through the landscape. Broad grooves near the equator look like ridges, perhaps formed by volcanic eruptions not of molten lava but icy water or hydrocarbons. No mountains or deep valleys are in sight. Streaks across the flat terrain may be dunes of windblown carbon-based compounds, what passes for topsoil on Titan. Such organic material, either sticky and tarlike or powdery or slushy, may cover a ''bedrock'' of water ice to depths of a few hundred feet. Much of it, possibly ethane, propane and acetylene, must form in chemical reactions on the surface or rain out of the smoggy sky known to be rich in methane and now found to contain benzene. With this abundance of hydrocarbons, the sky and surface of Titan would be dangerously flammable, like a petroleum refinery primed to erupt in fire, if there were any free oxygen there. So what are scientists of the $3.2 billion Cassini mission to make of such a world? ''The surface is like a jigsaw puzzle for which the picture is not provided on the box cover,'' said Dr. Jonathan Lunine of the University of Arizona. Dr. Charles Elachi, director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here, where the Cassini mission is controlled, likened the problem of understanding Titan to reading a mystery novel. ''Each time you flip the page you learn something new,'' he said, ''but you don't know the whole story until you've read the whole book.'' Some early interpretations of the Titanian surface lean heavily on what was already known from ground-based and previous spacecraft observations about the moon's nitrogen-methane atmosphere, or from comparisons with findings of other icy moons, notably Jupiter's Ganymede. Dr. Soderblom said it made ''a minute amount of sense'' that, given the composition of Titan's atmosphere, the fluids that might have shaped some of the landscape were mixtures of methane and ethane. Citing observations of a phenomenon that is probably similar on Ganymede, he said some features on Titan could be from volcanic eruptions, upwellings of water ice mixed with ammonia and methane, which would lower the fluids' freezing point. Dr. Lunine said the fact that no craters had been seen ''tells us that Titan's surface is young,'' its basins filled in with material from such volcanic upwellings or hydrocarbon precipitation from the sky. Other remote-sensing instruments on Cassini detected evidence that Titan had lost three-quarters of its original atmosphere. Much of its light nitrogen seems to have escaped over time. But the methane content appears to have remained constant. It could be that Titan has replenished methane escaping from the atmosphere, said Dr. Tobias Owen of the University of Hawaii at Manoa. ''Where did it come from?'' he added. ''That is the question.'' Scientists suggested that some atmospheric hydrocarbons were being replenished from underground sources of liquid methane. Both before and after Cassini's close encounter, scientists often reminded themselves and others not to make hasty interpretations or be discouraged. They recalled the experience of the earliest spacecraft explorations of Mars. In the first three flybys of Mars, in the 1960's, Dr. Owen pointed out, the Mariner spacecraft ''happened by chance to go over the most boring portion'' of that planet, where the unrelieved cratered landscape invited comparisons with the desolate surface of Earth's Moon. Not until Mariner 9 began orbiting Mars in 1971, photographing its entirety, did scientists see the volcanic peaks and wide canyons, dry channels where water probably once flowed and other traces of a dynamic past. This renewed speculation that life might have existed there. Scientists do not expect to find life on bitterly cold Titan, 290 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. At best, they hope that in the dynamic chemistry of Titan's atmosphere, and possibly its surface, to find insights into how life originated in Earth's early history. Titan is the only moon with a substantial atmosphere; the main constituent of it is nitrogen, as is Earth's. But that will take time and patience, scientists say. Cassini's cameras and infrared sensors surveyed only part of one side of Titan, and its radar returned images of only a narrow strip representing no more than 1 percent of the surface. Over the next four years, the craft is to make 44 more flybys of Titan. On 25 of these, scientists expect the radar to explore at least a quarter of Titan's landscape. Flight controllers said that Cassini, which has been orbiting Saturn and the planet's retinue of moons since June 30, was performing flawlessly and had already adjusted its course for another encounter with Titan on Dec. 13. Then, on Dec. 24, the spacecraft is to release a smaller craft for a more intimate exploration. The Huygens craft, built and operated by the European Space Agency, is to enter Titan's atmosphere on Jan. 14 and parachute to the surface, collecting data and taking pictures all the way. If it survives the landing, Huygens may be able to transmit views of the surface for 30 minutes, perhaps long enough to answer some of the questions about a frozen land of water ice carpeted in gooey, powdery or plasticlike carbon-based compounds. Or Huygens may splash down in a lake of methane and ethane, sinking silently to the depths of the mystery.", "title": "As the Veil on Titan Is Lifted, 'What We See Is Very Alien'"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/News/Science", "Top/News/Health", "Top/News/Science/Space and Cosmos"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Science; Health", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Science Desk", "print_page_number": "2", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "F", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/science/space/02tita.html", "print_column": "2", "slug": "02TITA$02"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "I had two interns to supervise that month, and the minute they sat down for our first meeting, I sensed how the month would unfold. The man's white coat was immaculate, its pockets empty save for a sleek Palm Pilot that contained his list of patients. The woman used a large loose-leaf notebook instead, every dog-eared page full of lists of things to do and check, consultants to call, questions to ask. Her pockets were stuffed, and whenever she sat down, little handbooks of drug doses, wadded phone messages, pens, highlighters and tourniquets spilled onto the floor. The man worked the hours legally mandated by the state, not a minute more, and sometimes considerably less. He was seldom in the hospital before 8 in the morning, and left by 5 unless he was on call. He ate a leisurely lunch every day and was never late for rounds. The woman got to the hospital around dawn and was on the move for the rest of the day. Sometimes she went home when she was supposed to, but sometimes, if one of her patients was particularly sick, she would sign out to the covering intern and keep working, often talking to patients' relatives long into the night. ''I am now breaking the law,'' she would announce cheerfully to no one in particular, then trot off to do just a few final chores. The man had a strict definition of what it meant to be a doctor. He did not, for instance, ''do nurses' work'' (his phrase). When one of his patients needed a specimen sent to the lab and the nurse didn't get around to it, neither did he. No matter how important the job was, no matter how hard I pressed him, he never gave in. If I spoke sternly to him, he would turn around and speak just as sternly to the nurse. The woman did everyone's work. She would weigh her patients if necessary (nurses' work), feed them (aides' work), find salt-free pickles for them (dietitians' work) and wheel them to X-ray (transporters' work). The man was cheerful, serene and well rested. The woman was overtired, hyperemotional and constantly late. The man was interested in his patients, but they never kept him up at night. The woman occasionally called the hospital from home to check on hers. The man played tennis on his days off. The woman read medical articles. At least, she read the beginnings; she tended to fall asleep halfway through. I felt as if I was in a medieval morality play that month, living with two costumed symbols of opposing philosophies in medical education. The woman was working the way interns used to: total immersion seasoned with exhaustion and adrenaline. As far as she was concerned, her patients were her exclusive responsibility. The man was an intern of the new millennium. His hours and duties were delimited; he saw himself as part of a health care team, and his patients' welfare as a shared responsibility. This new model of medical internship got some important validation in The New England Journal of Medicine last week, when Harvard researchers reported the effects of reducing interns' work hours to 60 per week from 80 (now the mandated national maximum). The shorter workweek required a larger staff of interns to spell one another at more frequent intervals. With shorter hours, the interns got more sleep at home, dozed off less at work and made considerably fewer bad mistakes in patient care. Why should such an obvious finding need an elaborate controlled study to establish? Why should it generate not only two long articles in the world's most prestigious medical journal, but also three long, passionate editorials? Because the issue here is bigger than just scheduling and manpower. The progressive shortening of residents' work hours spells nothing less than a change in the ethos of medicine itself. It means the end of Dr. Kildare, Superstar -- that lone, heroic healer, omniscient, omnipotent and ever-present. It means a revolution in the complex medical hierarchy that sustained him. Willy-nilly, medicine is becoming democratized, a team sport. We can only hope the revolution will be bloodless. Everything will have to change. Doctors will have to learn to work well with others. They will have to learn to write and speak with enough clarity and precision so that the patient's story remains accurate as care passes from hand to hand. They will have to stop saying ''my patient'' and begin to say ''our patient'' instead. It may be, when the dust settles, that the system will be more functional, less error-prone. It may be that we will simply have substituted one set of problems for another. We may even find that nothing much has changed. Even in the Harvard data, there was an impressive range in the hours that the interns under study worked. Some logged in over 90 hours in their 80-hour workweek. Some put in 75 instead. Medicine has always attracted a wide spectrum of individuals, from the lazy and disaffected to the deeply committed. Even draconian scheduling policies may not change basic personality traits, or the kind of doctors that interns grow up to be. My month with the intern of the past and the intern of the future certainly argues for the power of the individual work ethic. Try as I might, it was not within my power to modify the way either of them functioned. The woman cared too much. The man cared too little. She worked too hard, and he could not be prodded into working hard enough. They both made careless mistakes. When patients died, the man shrugged and the woman cried. If for no other reason than that one, let us hope that the medicine of the future still has room for people like her.

A herd of goats was at one edge, drinking and defecating in the same spot. The sun was going down behind a thorn tree, backlighting 50 naked boys splashing one another in the warm dusk. Where a colonialist romantic would have seen a landscape of native innocence, I saw a horror movie: there were worms in the brown water invisibly digging right through the boys' skin. Kwa'al is a market village that exists only because the region's red dirt tracks meet a paved road here. Each morning, women walk in with sacks on their heads: potatoes, onions and cabbages that they pile by the road, hoping to earn $3 or so. It is rural and traditional; a nearby village is famous for the dogs it raises for meat. Kwa'al is also a ''schisto village.'' A third of its children have blood in their urine because of schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease transmitted by water snails. Also known as bilharzia, it is the second most common tropical disease in Africa, after malaria. Stuck to the mud wall of a building is a Health Ministry poster showing a silhouette of a squatting boy staring down, troubled, at the scarlet stream running out of him. The blood is just a red flag for the real problem: children with heavy infestations of the worms, known as schistosomes, are stunted and do poorly in school. An hour in Kwa'al is a mural of parasitology: a living schematic of how the life cycle of a human boy intersects the life cycle of a waterborne worm and the financial cycles of global public health. When a team from the Carter Center and a pediatric parasitologist from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Frank O. Richards Jr., drove into Kwa'al at 5 p.m., after a long day visiting villages at the ends of dirt roads, the local health volunteers began a demonstration of their prevention techniques. As one man lectured some local chiefs, using a flip chart to explain the worm's life cycle, the children lined up at a small wood table. Their names were jotted in a notebook, and their heights measured on a stick with yellow, green, blue and red bars. Those who reached yellow, 35 inches tall, were handed one pill. The tallest children were handed four, which they swallowed with a cup of water dipped from a cooking pot. In the West, doses are figured by the child's weight. But scales get broken, and marked sticks are easy to make. And all the children were so thin that height indicated weight accurately enough. Unlike the nearby dog village, Kwa'al is Muslim -- a prayer meeting with a loudspeaker at a mud mosque a few yards away nearly overpowered the lecturer -- and Ramadan had begun. The children had to get dispensation from daytime fasting to take their pills. In some areas, health programs just shut down for Ramadan; at night, Nigeria's roads are too dangerous. Almost all the children in line were boys. The volunteers survey schoolchildren, and Muslim girls here usually stay home, so surveys may miss them. But boys also have many more worms. In Africa, girls fetch water, but boys swim. Meskwal Yusuf, a 15 year-old who looked 10, said he was ''very happy'' to get his dose. ''I could see red in my urine, and my penis pained me,'' he explained. ''I told my father. He told me people would come and bring drugs free, so I should not worry.'' The pills were praziquantel, which kill virtually all the worms. They cost 7 cents apiece. They are cheap because they're generic, made by companies in Germany, Cyprus and South Korea. (In 1983, when only one company made them, the pills cost $4.44 each at pharmacy prices.) But the companies are not willing to donate the pills, so charities must buy them. The Carter Center can afford 200,000 a year -- enough to treat six counties in central Nigeria. According to a 1995 study by Dr. Michael Reich of the Harvard School of Public Health, it would take 423 million praziquantel pills a year to treat schistosomiasis worldwide. Together, the three drug companies make only 89 million. ''When you hear that, you realize the value of the donations from Glaxo and Merck and Pfizer,'' said Dr. Richards, the C.D.C. consultant. (Pfizer, Merck and GlaxoSmithKline donate millions of their patented deworming and antibiotic drugs, which can cost several dollars each in American pharmacies, to programs fighting other parasites.) Because of the chronic praziquantel shortage, the World Health Organization rations it: any village where fewer than 20 percent of the school-age children have blood in their urine gets no treatment. ''Imagine that in Manhattan, if a kid showed up with blood in his urine,'' Dr. Richards said. In any village where 20 to 50 percent of the children have bloody urine, only children get pills. And in any village where more than 50 percent have symptoms, the whole village gets pills. In Kwa'al, 36 percent do. When the health volunteer took questions, several parents said they had blood in their urine, so why didn't they get pills too? Those were the rules, the volunteer said. ''I'm a pediatrician,'' Dr. Richards said. ''I'd love to blanket these areas. When you treat kids, their growth rates increase and their academic performance improves. But our position is W.H.O.'s position. We're not breaking ground here.'' We jumped back in the truck to find the swimming hole, about 100 yards down the road. Dr. Richards bent down to pick up a tiny snail. It was in a quarter-inch of water, but he used a leaf, not wanting to dip even the tip of his finger in. ''You can't keep a kid from urinating when he swims,'' he explained. ''The eggs are in the urine. They infect the snails and develop into a form that invades human skin -- a sharp head and a tail, sort of like a sperm. The head goes in, the tail snaps off, and it sets up shop in the human. Then, when it releases its eggs, they burrow their way through the body to reach the bladder.'' He added, pointing to the youngsters splayed out in six inches of water, ''That's why the boys have the heavy infections. They're lying there soaking up the schisto.'' As if a lifeguard had shouted, the boys all came running out of the pond at once, toward me. I was standing near where they had dropped their shirts and shorts, but the piles were so dirty they might have been cow patties. The last one out was limping on a stick, his back bent sideways. ''Look,'' Dr. Richards shouted. ''Polio.'' More than one plague had visited Kwa'al. As they dressed, I recognized Meskwal and others I had seen at the pill table. They had run here faster than we had driven. Did the water, I asked, make their skin itch? Yes, they answered. It meant that new parasites were digging in. I asked them if they realized that this was how they got the blood in their urine. ''Yes, we know,'' Meskwal said. ''Our parents tell us not to come. But as there is no water in the river, this is the only water we have to bathe with. This is the only way we can wash our clothes.'' As long as boys like water, schistosomiasis will never be eradicated. The world is not ready to provide chlorinated pools, and even a widely heralded United Nations plan from the 1980's to provide clean wells in every country never came close to reaching its goals. Instead, we settle for control: for a few thousand lucky boys, an annual deworming that does not cure, but substantially cuts their parasite load, giving them a chance to grow up -- and outgrow the swimming hole.

Doubleday, $24.95. Why, the geneticist-author of this provocative book asks, is spirituality such a powerful and universal force? Why do so many people believe in things they cannot see, smell, taste, hear or touch? Dr. Dean Hamer, a molecular geneticist, argues persuasively that genes predispose humans to believe that ''spirituality is one of our basic human inheritances,'' and that, indeed, there is a specific individual gene associated with faith. ''I propose,'' he writes, ''that spirituality has a biological mechanism akin to birdsong, albeit a far more complex and nuanced one.'' Genes, Dr. Hamer adds, do not tell the whole story. Humans' genetic predisposition for spiritual belief is expressed in response to personal experience and the cultural environment, and it is shaped by them. But the genes, he says, ''act by influencing the brain's capability for various types and forms of consciousness, which become the basis for spiritual experiences.'' In other words, an inclination toward religious faith is no accident. What captured Dr. Hamer's attention was a gene, called VMAT2, that controls the flow of mood-regulating chemicals called monoamines in the brain. Crucial to making the connection was a scale called ''self-transcendence,'' which, the author writes, ''provides a numerical measure of people's capacity to reach out beyond themselves -- to see everything in the world as part of one great totality.'' How to measure such an amorphous linkage was tricky, given that one cannot simply examine the genome sequence and identify the location of any ''God genes.'' ''Even if we knew the biochemical function of all the genes,'' he writes, ''we would not know how they interact with one another, and with the environment, to mold a trait as complex as spirituality.'' So, convinced that the brain chemicals controlled by the ''God gene'' influenced spirituality by altering consciousness, he studied DNA samples from volunteers, trying to identify sequences of DNA that might be involved in the degrees of spirituality observed from one person to the next. He was, he says, looking for what has been called the ''causes of human diversity,'' not the reason that humans have aptitude for spirituality ''but the reason that some have more or less than others.'' Dr. Hamer is best known for a 1993 study linking male homosexuality to a region of the X chromosome. Other researchers tried to replicate the findings in 1999 but were unable to do so. Dr. Hamer writes that while he found an apparent association between VMAT2 and spirituality, the gene is not the only one to affect spirituality. ''It plays only a small, if key, role,'' he writes. ''Many other genes and environmental factors also are involved. Nevertheless, the gene is important because it points out the mechanism by which spirituality is manifested in the brain.'' He also points out that science can tell us whether there are ''God genes,'' but not whether there is a God. ''Our genes can predispose us to believe,'' he writes, ''but they don't tell us what to believe in. Our faith is part of our cultural heritage, and some of the beliefs in any religion evolve over time.'' Needless to say, many geneticists are skeptical. When Dr. Hamer told his former boss at the National Institutes of Health that he was writing this book, her suggestion was, ''Wait until you've retired.'' Another colleague said: ''A God gene? That's got to be nonsense. Have you replicated it?'' Theologians, too, are not always thrilled when science encroaches on their territory. ''Theologians often see science as irrelevant, incomprehensible, or even destructive,'' Dr. Hamer said. Still, he writes, the fact that spirituality has a genetic component implies that it has evolved for a purpose. ''There is now reasonable evidence that spirituality is in fact beneficial to our physical as well as mental health. Faith may not only make people feel better, it may actually make them better people.''

Now that many people who could be protected cannot be immunized, everyone seems to want the vaccine against this costly, debilitating and sometimes life-threatening viral illness. Perhaps next year people will remember this desire to protect themselves against the flu when, we hope, there will be enough vaccine available to meet the demand. Having twice had pneumonia and bronchitis after the flu (first at 17 and later at 27), I have long advocated annual flu shots for every adult, even the young and otherwise healthy. I have not once had the flu in the 15 years or so that I've received annual flu shots. The longstanding recommendation that the vaccine should be given only to the elderly, the chronically ill and people like the police and health care workers who perform essential services mainly arose from the limited amount a vaccine produced annually for many years. Thus, it was necessary to offer the vaccine first to those who needed it most. But in recent years, vaccine supplies increased, making it possible for many healthy adults to be immunized. In an average year, according to the latest estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 114,000 people in this country are hospitalized and 36,000 die from flu-related complications. Even among flu victims who simply stay home for a few days, the cost to employers and society is staggering. Hoping for Mild This year I'm in the same boat as millions of other Americans, young and old, who in all likelihood will not be able to get the vaccine, at least not before January, if then. The most we can hope for is that it will be a relatively mild flu season, lacking a major genetic shift in the most devastating form of flu virus, Type A. So far, no such shift has occurred, but there's no telling when this genetically fickle virus will don another medically disastrous coat. Meanwhile, I plan to do my best to avoid contracting the flu, and I hope you will too. And not just for your own well-being but also for the well-being of those you live, work and socialize with, not to mention casual contacts on public transportation and in stores, schools and movies. It is a simple fact that the more people who get the flu, the more influenza viruses will be circulating that can make others ill as well. Unlike viruses that cause measles, mumps or chickenpox, those that cause influenza in people come in two basic forms, Types A and B, each readily undergoing genetic change as it passes through various animal species. And every time a human flu virus is changed significantly, a new vaccine must be produced. So each year the few companies that make flu vaccine must go through rather frantic production schedules to produce new vaccines that include protection against the genetic variants circulating during early summer that are expected to become the cause of widespread illness the next winter. Since the viruses are changing all the time, sometimes the vaccine that becomes available in fall does not protect against all the viral forms that may cause the flu that year. But most of the time, vaccine makers do a commendable job in producing a vaccine that is 70 to 90 percent effective in preventing influenza that year. And even when breakthrough illness occurs in immunized people, it is usually milder than would otherwise be the case. Further complicating matters is the fact that even if the virus does not mutate from year to year, flu vaccine has to be administered annually, since protection from this killed virus vaccine rarely lasts much more than a year. (The live-virus vaccine, FluMist, administered as a nasal spray, is recommended only for healthy people age 5 through 49.) Minimizing the Risk Once you realize how easy it is to transmit flu viruses from one person to another, you will see why annual immunization is the preferred means of prevention. Still, there are steps you can take to help minimize your exposure or, if you should become ill, how many others you infect. The flu spreads much more readily than a cold. In most cases, it moves from one person to another via virus-contaminated airborne droplets released when an infected person coughs, sneezes or even engages in a normal conversation. The virus can also spread through hands and inanimate objects. As with cold viruses, flu viruses can live for an hour or more on an infected person's hands and on objects handled by contaminated hands. Furthermore, the flu can be spread by people who haven't yet developed symptoms and don't even know they are vectors. The incubation period -- the time between becoming infected with the virus and knowing you are ill -- is one to three days, and during that time you can spread the virus. Once flu symptoms develop, you remain contagious for another three to five days, and that means you can transmit the flu to others for about one week. Efforts to contain influenza are further complicated by the fact that school-age children are believed to be the main people spreading the disease. Children are rarely immunized against the flu and most get only a mild case, hard to distinguish from the common cold or some other pesky childhood infection. Of course, teachers, parents and others who take care of them can hardly avoid being exposed to sick children and are sitting ducks to become flu victims themselves. So, what can you do to reduce your risk? You can start by washing your hands -- 20 seconds with warm, soapy water -- as often as possible and especially after touching publicly used handrails and other such objects. And avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth until you wash. Also avoid using antibacterial soaps, which do nothing to block viruses and, many experts believe, may encourage the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. If you are out and about and no running water is available, use a packaged wipe. Several packets of them can easily fit into a purse or pocket. Instead of shaking hands, consider nodding to a new or renewed acquaintance. A face mask, however, is of questionable effectiveness. Keep your immune system in the best possible shape by regularly eating wholesome meals and snacks, especially lots of vegetables and fruits, getting adequate sleep, drinking plenty of nonalcoholic fluids, and doing moderately vigorous exercise on most days. (Excessive exercise can suppress immunity rather than enhance it.) If you think you were exposed to the flu, you may try taking echinacea, with or without vitamin C, for a day or two. But avoid daily use of this regimen since it can have the reverse effect if overdone. There are a few antiviral remedies that can decrease the severity of a Type A flu infection if treatment is started within two days of the onset of symptoms. They are amantadine (Symmetrel) and rimantadine (Flumadine). These drugs are also effective as preventives for high-risk people in settings like nursing homes. Two newer drugs, zanamivir (Relenza), an inhaled product, and oseltamivir (Tamiflu), an oral product, can reduce the severity of a flu infection regardless of viral type. As a treatment once symptoms start, they are taken twice a day for five days. They can also be used for prevention for periods of about two weeks. PERSONAL HEALTH", "title": "No Vaccines?

Gloria Rapport's husband raised his arm to her, fist poised. ''He was very close to striking me,'' she said. What had provoked him? ''Nothing,'' she said. ''I asked him to get in the car.'' Mrs. Rapport's husband, Richard, 71, has Alzheimer's disease. His forgetfulness and confusion began about nine years ago, not long after they married. More recently, emotional troubles have loomed. Anxiety came first: he suddenly feared being left alone in the house. Outbursts of anger followed. The man she had always known to be kind and gentle could in an instant turn ''cunning, nasty, aggressive, menacing,'' she said. ''The behavioral changes I've seen are absolutely frightening,'' she said. ''I understand now why so many families institutionalize someone, because I was afraid of him.'' Though memory loss is the best-known Alzheimer's symptom, the disease can also cause psychiatric problems that lead to profound changes in personality, mood and behavior. People who were happy and good-natured for most of their lives suddenly become fearful, depressed, deluded or angry, sometimes even violent. Many families hide such symptoms, and perhaps as a result, psychiatric problems were long thought to affect only a minority of people with Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia. Only recently has it become clear that emotional and behavioral troubles are nearly universal among people with Alzheimer's disease, and the problems are frequently intractable and more upsetting to families than the mental slowing. Depression and apathy are the most common psychiatric symptoms. But agitated, aggressive and psychotic behaviors are a leading reason Alzheimer's patients are put into nursing homes. (The other is incontinence.) ''They are extraordinarily distressing and wearing on caregivers,'' said Dr. Constantine Lyketsos, a psychiatrist and Alzheimer's expert at Johns Hopkins. More than four million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, and the number is expected to increase as the population ages. Dr. Lyketsos said that doctors had become increasingly aware that elderly people who suddenly showed signs of mental illness might actually have Alzheimer's disease, though in the past they might have been given a diagnosis like ''late-life psychosis,'' depression or nervous breakdown. Mrs. Rapport said: ''Most families won't talk about it. I equate this disease to how leprosy used to be. We've lost good friends, and we have family members who won't have anything to do with us. I think they're afraid of it, and there's a real stigma that the person is crazy. I think it's why a lot of families hide people away who have it.'' The symptoms distress not just families, but the patients themselves. ''If your moods are labile or you get anxious and scared, there's a fair bit of suffering that goes with that,'' Dr. Lyketsos said. ''If you have visions, or develop ideas that people are trying to steal from you or hurt you, there's a fair bit of suffering.'' The emotional disorders can be difficult or impossible to treat. There is no drug specifically approved for psychiatric problems in Alzheimer's patients, so doctors try to treat the symptoms, using drugs meant for other illnesses. They prescribe a wide array of medicines, including antidepressants, antipsychotics used to treat schizophrenia and stimulants and drugs approved for anxiety, epilepsy and memory impairment. Sometimes the drugs seem to work, sometimes they do not. Dr. Lon Schneider, a psychiatrist who studies and treats Alzheimer's disease at the University of Southern California, said: ''Whenever you see a long list of drugs of different classes, you know there's no good treatment. You get a high degree of uncertainty, and companies hyping their antipsychotics.'' Over all, Dr. Lyketsos said, the effects of the drugs are moderate. But he added that depression seemed to be the most treatable symptom, and could be eased in half to two-thirds of Alzheimer's patients with drugs like Prozac, which enhance brain levels of the chemical serotonin. But some psychiatric drugs can have troubling side effects, particularly antipsychotics, which may increase the risk of stroke, diabetes, weight gain, high cholesterol, sleepiness and Parkinson's-like movement disorders. There is ''substantial and increasing controversy'' about the use of antipsychotics and other drugs to treat behavioral problems in people with dementia, Dr. Schneider said. Twenty percent of all antipsychotic prescriptions are for the elderly, but there is no good evidence of their effectiveness, he said, adding that the results of a government-sponsored study are due next year. Meanwhile, behavior therapy and activity programs at adult day care centers may work at least as well as drugs in some patients, and families are urged to try them first. Teaching relatives and the nursing home staff what to expect from a person with dementia and how to avoid confrontations can help to keep the peace. ''There's a tendency for us to want to correct people who are demented,'' Dr. Schneider said. ''You don't do that.'' Researchers think the psychiatric symptoms result in part from brain damage, as the disease eats away at nerve centers that regulate mood, perception and the ability to control impulses. But some problems may also arise from patients' anguish and frustration over their increasing confusion and inability to function. Apathy, depression, irritability, sleep disturbances, agitation and aggression are common. Anxiety, delusions, paranoia and hallucinations may also occur, as well as disinhibition, or loss of impulse control. Patients sometimes think family members are impostors or intruders, or are out to harm or rob them. They may accuse spouses of cheating and slap, push or shout at relatives. Testifying in March before a Senate hearing on violence among people with dementia, Dr. Lyketsos said that every year, about 15 percent to 18 percent of dementia patients had physically violent outbursts. They can be set off by changes in routine or even a room that is too hot or cold, or discomfort from dental problems or illnesses like colds or bladder infections that patients may not be able to interpret or express. Patients who can no longer bathe or use the toilet without help often misinterpret and resent efforts to help them. Most of the incidents are minor and no one is seriously hurt, Dr. Lyketsos said. ''In fact, most of the time we never hear about it, sometimes because the caregivers feel embarrassed or ashamed to report it, or may blame themselves,'' he told the committee. But on rare occasions, real harm is done. Last year, a man at an assisted living center in Eugene, Ore., shot and killed his wife, an acquaintance and himself; all three had dementia. Dr. Jason Karlawish, a geriatrician at the University of Pennsylvania's Institute on Aging, said one of the first things he advised families with Alzheimer's patients was to get rid of any guns in the house. Mrs. Rapport, who lives in Williamsville, N.Y., a suburb of Buffalo, gives her husband a drug called Seroquel to decrease agitation. It is an antipsychotic made by AstraZeneca, and is generally used for schizophrenia. The drug was prescribed by Dr. Pierre Tariot, a professor of psychiatry, medicine and neurology at the University of Rochester, who studied it for 10 weeks in 333 Alzheimer's patients and found that a high dose, 200 milligrams a day, reduced agitation without severe side effects. Mrs. Rapport said: ''I think the drug is absolutely wonderful. It brought him back to the same pleasant person he's always been.'' Mr. Rapport has been taking Seroquel for about a year. Several times, he has become combative again, and so Mrs. Rapport increased the dose. Without the drug, she said, she would probably not be able to keep her husband at home. Each family seems to have a different -- and changing -- recipe of drugs. Gertrude Affannato, 82, of Philadelphia was taking a memory drug, Aricept, and an antidepressant, Celexa, but a few years ago, as her dementia progressed, she became lethargic and reluctant to leave the house. So her doctor, a specialist at a dementia clinic, added vitamin E and Ritalin, a stimulant. ''It seemed to get her out of her shell and get a spark out of her,'' said her husband, Louis, also 82. ''We were able to go out and do things.'' But recently, he said, ''she started to get belligerent with me at home and with some of the patients at the day care center.'' ''She never said a foul word in her life, and now, the least little thing and she'll curse you out,'' he said. She sometimes hits or pinches him when he tries to bathe her, and he said he worried that she would strike another patient or a nurse, and be thrown out of day care. ''Without that,'' he said, ''I don't know if I could handle it.'' Their doctor reduced the Ritalin, and Mrs. Affannato seems to be getting along better with the other patients, he said. But the lethargy and apathy have returned. As soon as she gets home from day care in the afternoon, she wants to eat dinner and go to bed. Then she wakes at 3 or 4 a.m., and wants him to get up, too. ''This is one of the toughest jobs I've ever had to do,'' he said. Bob Simons, of Westmont, N.J., took care of his wife, Sylvia, 78, a former kindergarten teacher, at home for three years after her Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed. ''My wife is apathetic,'' Mr. Simons said during a telephone interview in August. ''She's not depressed. Nothing makes any difference to her. She can spend hours in the bathroom examining all the jars and bottles she has on the counter. Once, I waited to see how long she would stay in there, and it was eight hours. She didn't come out for food or anything.'' At times, Mrs. Simons suffered from hallucinations, imagining there were strangers in the house. She became careless about her appearance and sometimes wanted to sleep in her clothes instead of changing at bedtime. ''Sometimes I have to physically push her down on the couch and say, 'Take off your blouse, take off your skirt,''' Mr. Simons said, ''and she'll say, 'Oh, I was talking to the nice Bob before, now I'm talking to the mean Bob.''' ''It's like I'm married to a different woman,'' he said. She was taking several medications meant to slow memory loss, though Mr. Simons said he did not know whether they were helping. ''She might be the same way if I took her off all these drugs, but you're afraid to take a chance,'' he said. ''If she had a good day when I waved a rubber chicken over her head, I'd be waving a rubber chicken over her head every day.'' But Mrs. Simons seemed to get worse each day, he said, adding that he might eventually have to put her into a long-term care facility. In September, he did. It is a decision that most spouses dread, but must consider. Mrs. Rapport said: ''I'm happy because we can still have a life together -- a different life. We still have the companionship. I know Richard would do the same for me. It's part of our journey together. There are no guarantees. I want to keep him home as long as I can.''

The vaccine, which works by making people immune to a common sexually transmitted virus that causes the cancer, is not yet available. But its maker, Merck Laboratories, expects to apply for approval late next year, said Dr. Eliav Barr, a research director at the company. Worldwide, there are 470,000 new cases of cervical cancer a year and 225,000 deaths. Most of the deaths occur in poorer countries where women do not have regular Pap tests, which can detect cancers or precancers early enough for them to be cured. In the United States, where Pap testing is widespread, 11,000 new cases are expected this year and about 4,000 deaths. If the vaccine is approved, Dr. Barr said, it will be recommended for use in young adults and in children starting at age 9 or 10, before they become sexually active and encounter the virus. Once cancer develops, it is too late for the vaccine to help. The median age at which young people in the United States first have sex is 15. Boys as well as girls should be vaccinated, researchers say. Men are not usually harmed by the virus, but they carry it and infect women, so immunizing men will protect women. It will also protect men who have sex with men, a group with rising rates of anal cancer caused by the same viruses that cause cervical cancer. Merck has been testing the vaccine for four years in 1,505 women ages 16 to 23, Dr. Barr said. He presented the company's latest findings at a conference in Washington. The women were given three shots in six months -- 750 got placebos and 755 the real vaccine -- and had Pap tests every six months. After four years, the vaccine was 100 percent effective: 12 women in the placebo group and none in the treated group had precancerous growths on the cervix. Lab tests showed that their levels of immunity to the virus stayed high, suggesting that the vaccine might provide long-term protection without the need for booster shots later in life, Dr. Barr said. But, he added: ''We can't exclude the need for boosters. Women are at risk for many years.'' The vaccine works against viruses that belong to a group called human papillomaviruses, or HPV. Nearly every case of cervical cancer is caused by HPV. The viruses are sexually transmitted, extremely common and almost impossible to avoid. At least half the adults in the United States have been infected. More than 30 types of HPV infect the human genital area. Only some types cause cancer; others cause genital warts. A type known as HPV-16 causes 50 percent of cervical cancers, and HPV-18 causes 20 percent. Other types cause the rest. But even the cancer-causing types are harmless in most people because their immune systems fight them off. The virus persists in some women, however, causing lesions on the cervix. Most lesions go away, but some turn cancerous. The vaccine Merck described provides immunity only to HPV-16, and it is not the one the company plans to market; it was developed as a prototype to determine whether humans could be made immune to any strain of HPV. Merck will seek approval for a more broadly effective vaccine, which it has been testing since 2001 in 25,000 men and women in 34 countries. That vaccine will immunize against four strains: the main causes of cervical cancer, HPV-16 and 18, and two other viruses that cause genital warts. Researchers included the wart strains to make it more appealing to men, who may want protection against genital warts, which can turn into large, ugly growths. Dr. Barr said Merck had already built a factory dedicated to producing the vaccine. The company has not yet said what it would charge for the product. The vaccine does not contain whole viruses; it consists of proteins normally found on the outer shell of the virus. The proteins, called viruslike particles, are produced by yeasts sliced with viral genes.", "title": "Vaccine Works to Prevent Cervical Cancer"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/Health", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Vaccination and Immunization", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Cervical Cancer", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Cancer", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Pediatrics", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Healthcare", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Medicine and Health", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Activities and Interests/Family", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology and Science", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Viruses", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Venereal Diseases", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Health", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Health & Fitness", "print_page_number": "7", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "F", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/health/02canc.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "02CANC$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Nightmare on Elms It may be true that great oaks from little acorns grow, but the problem with British elm trees, apparently, is that they grew from a Roman clone. This genetic uniformity, researchers say, may have contributed to their rapid demise during an outbreak of Dutch elm disease in the 1970's. In a study in the journal Nature, Spanish biologists traced the origin of the English elm using genetic analysis of elm trees from across Europe. The analysis showed similarities among trees from Britain, Italy and the Iberian Peninsula. The researchers say this evidence supports a hypothesis that the British trees are descended from an elm that was cloned by the Romans 2,000 years ago for use in wine production. The tree, known as the Atinian elm, was used to train vines in the vineyards. (Cloning of trees is very common, and not particularly difficult; it usually involves cutting a stem or root from a tree and planting it.) The use of the Atinian elm was advocated by a Roman agronomist, Columella, who had vineyards in Latium in Italy and in Spain. That helps to explain why clone descendants are found in Italy and Spain. The researchers suggest it was probably moved to Britain during Roman settlement there. Then, normal propagation took over (the elms produce pollen and are very effective at spreading themselves) until the English elm became a dominant feature in the landscape. In the mid-70's, however, more than 25 million of them died. If the trees had been more genetically diverse, the researchers say, more would have survived. That One-of-a-Kind Scent The sense of smell is a powerful thing for people, dogs and other mammals, but it's seldom been shown to be such a big deal for birds. Sure, birds can smell, but just how well-developed the sense is, particularly in recognizing other birds, has not been fully explored. Enter the Antarctic prion, a small monogamous seabird that nests in burrows on islands in and around Antarctica. After foraging trips, the returning prion can find its own burrow, and now researchers have discovered why: it recognizes its mate's odor. The researchers, from the Center for Functional and Evolutionary Ecology in Montpellier, France, and the University of California at Davis, studied prions on Ile Verte, a very small island in the Kerguelen Archipelago. The birds have a musty scent that permeates cotton bags used to move them. So the researchers used these bags in a Y-shaped maze, to see which of two odors a bird would be attracted to. In a first series of tests, they found that the birds preferred other birds' odors over their own. Then, when given a choice between a mate's odor and that of another bird, the prions preferred the more familiar one. The findings were reported in the journal Science. In a prion pair, while one bird is foraging at sea (on trips that can last up to two weeks), the other is tending to the nest. When the forager returns home, the nest is heavy with the scent of its partner. So the ability to recognize odors is very useful in helping the returning bird find its home. A Farewell Flight NASA has retired the last of its KC-135 weightlessness-training planes. The four-engine KC-135, a former military tanker, made its final flight on Friday, taking off from Ellington Field in Houston with about two dozen passengers. The plane, known as the ''vomit comet,'' made about 50 of the parabolic arcs, resulting in about a half-minute of weightlessness each time. Among other activities, engineers tested tile repair tools for the space shuttle. This KC-135, the eighth plane in a program dating to 1957, carried several thousand passengers, including many students, during 10 years of flights. It will be replaced by a twin-engine C-9, which is similar to a commercial DC-9. There was no word on how many of those on the final flight, which included a couple of shuttle astronauts, got sick, but motion sickness usually affects about one in three passengers on the training flights. Catch the Wind, Change the Weather Wind turbines have been hailed as an environmentally friendly way to reduce the world's dependence on fossil fuels. But a wind farm with hundreds or even thousands of large turbines removes an enormous amount of energy from the air. So is wind power really benign? In one of the first studies to get at that question, scientists have modeled the impact of a hypothetical large-scale wind farm in the Great Plains. Their conclusion, reported in The Journal of Geophysical Research, is that thousands of turbines concentrated in one area can affect local weather. The impact, said the study's lead author, Dr. Somnath Baidya Roy, comes not so much from the turbines' rotor blades slowing down the air but from atmospheric mixing that occurs in the blades' wake. This creates warmer, drier conditions at the surface. ''We found that it's the turbulence generated by the rotor that is crucial when you talk about the impact on local meteorology,'' said Dr. Baidya Roy, who did the research at Princeton but is now at Duke. The simulated wind farm in the study consisted of 10,000 turbines, with rotor blades 165 feet long, in a 60-by-60-mile grid in north-central Oklahoma. In the Great Plains there is a nighttime stream of fast-moving air that separates cool, moist air near the ground from drier, warmer air above. The simulation found that the turbines catch this nocturnal jet, and the ensuing turbulence causes vertical mixing. The warming and drying that occur when the upper air mass reaches the surface is a significant change, Dr. Baidya Roy said, and is similar to the kinds of local atmospheric changes that occur with large-scale deforestation. ''You might see some kind of convective clouds or scattered rainfall here and there,'' Dr. Baidya Roy said. He noted that the study was only preliminary, but that it pointed to the need to improve rotor design to reduce turbulence. A wind farm of the size used in the simulation is much larger than those that have been built so far, Dr. Baidya Roy acknowledged, but it is not out of line with what is being considered as more power from renewable resources is sought. ''When you think of wind energy, people have a quaint idea of a lone windmill by the river,'' he said. ''We are quite a ways from that, actually.''", "title": "OBSERVATORY"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Italy", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Spain", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/United Kingdom", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Great Britain", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Antarctic Regions", "Top/News/U.S./West", "Top/News/Science", "Top/News/Science/Columns/Observatory", "Top/News/World/Europe", "Top/News/Health", "Top/News/Science/Space and Cosmos", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Genetics and Heredity", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Activities and Interests/Birds", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Activities and Interests/Wildlife", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe/Britain", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Polar Regions", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Polar Regions/Antarctic Regions", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe/Spain", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe/Italy"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Science; Health", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Science Desk", "print_page_number": "3", "print_section": "F", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_column": "1", "slug": "02OBSE$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Mention George Washington and the first image conjured up by most people is that of a stern, old white-haired man with a piercing gaze. Seeing him every day on dollar bills and quarters, it is hard to imagine that he was not born looking like that. A group of scientists, historians, archivists and other experts has set out to change all of that. Working from forensic evidence, documents and all manner of historical sleuthing, they are on a quest to put life and youth back into Washington. The curators of Washington's Mount Vernon estate in Virginia are starting his makeover by asking a basic question: What did George Washington actually look like? While there are hundreds of paintings of the first president, Washington posed for relatively few of them, and the image portrayed often was modified by the artist's style. To uncover the ''real'' George Washington, the estate drafted Dr. Jeffrey H. Schwartz, a professor of physical anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh and forensic expert, to lead a team that would reconstruct Washington's appearance based upon the best available sources. Using the latest computer imaging techniques, the team is trying to combine data from sculpture, paintings, physical artifacts like clothing and dentures, and written records to reproduce what Washington would have looked like in person. And to make the project even more challenging, the team is trying to push imaging science to its limits by accurately depicting Washington as he would have looked at three stages of his life: a 19-year-old surveyor who earned his military reputation fighting for the British in the French and Indian War; the 45-year-old who took command of the Colonial Army during the Revolutionary War; and the 57-year-old statesman as he was sworn in as the first president of the new republic. Dr. Schwartz said the base line image of Washington would be as he appeared at age 53, when the most accurate material on his appearance captured him. It was at this time that Jean-Antoine Houdon, a French neo-Classical sculptor famous for the accurate renditions of his subjects, went to Mount Vernon for several weeks to study, sketch and measure Washington for a life-size statue and bust. Washington's family members remarked that the resulting bust was the best likeness of him they had ever seen. Using this digital image of Washington at 53, the researchers first will use computer software to ''age'' him to what he looked like as a 57-year-old. Similar techniques are now used to portray the current appearance of children who have been missing for years. Then the project will enter unexplored territory when it tries to ''deconstruct,'' or de-age, Washington's image using custom software being written by an Arizona State University multidiscipline computer group called the Partnership for Research in Spatial Modeling, or Prism. ''This hasn't been done before, and we are not kidding ourselves into thinking it won't be a challenge,'' Dr. Schwartz said. ''But what an opportunity this is. How often do you get a chance to try reconstructing the father of our country?'' The reconstruction project, which will cost an estimated $500,000, is part of an $85 million campaign by Mount Vernon to restore and revitalize interest in one of the country's most pivotal leaders, said James C. Rees, executive director of the estate. The project involves building a museum and an education center that will feature 23 galleries and theaters, as well as a presidential library. Most of the construction will be underground, as not to disrupt usual tours of the grounds and mansion, which attract almost a million visitors a year. Mr. Rees said the new images of Washington would be used to create three life-size models depicting the man at three major moments in his life. Surveys of young people indicate that while they view Washington as important, they also think of him only as a stiff, boring old man. ''We want to change all of that,'' Mr. Rees said. ''Washington was athletic, adventurous and risk-taking, known to be one of the finest horsemen of his day and willing to meet challenges head-on. Some have called him the nation's first action hero.'' To determine Washington's true appearance, the research team is starting with Houdon's works. The sculptor visited Mount Vernon in October 1785 to observe Washington, making sketches, taking notes and using calipers and rules to measure his body. Houdon also made a ''life mask'' of Washington to capture his features, covering the general's face with plaster and having him lie down for several hours, breathing through two straws, while it hardened. With this information, Houdon made the bust of Washington that remains at Mount Vernon, and the full-size statue completed years later that resides in the rotunda of the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond. The reconstruction of Washington starts with putting information about his appearance into digital form where it can be compared and tweaked. The Arizona computer graphics group, led by Dr. Anshuman Razdan, has used portable laser scanning equipment to capture the three-dimensional shape of sculpture and other objects related to Washington's appearance. At Mount Vernon, Dr. Razdan and his team made a detailed scan of the Houdon bust, using laser light to render every curve and line of the sculpture as 1.25 million data points filling 1.5 gigabytes of computer space. This resulted in a wire-frame rendering of the bust that can be compared with scans of other objects to see common features and variations. The team scanned the Washington life mask at the Morgan Library in New York, a mask made from the bust at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington and the complete set of dentures at Mount Vernon. Members also went to Richmond and spent four days capturing details of the statue by Houdon in 700 scans from top to bottom. The modest Washington had asked that it be made no bigger than life-size. The researchers also are digitizing two-dimensional information from paintings and other sources that it will incorporate into the three-dimensional models. ''We want to get standard reference points, such as the forehead, bridge of the nose, cheeks and eye sockets, so we can compare them for common features,'' Dr. Razdan said. ''Then we have to write algorithms to let us manipulate the models, such as inserting dentures into the oral cavity, and seeing how they affect the shape of the face.'' Dr. Schwartz said he was trying to accurately represent Washington not only in facial appearance, but also in size, shape and volume. Records indicate that Washington was about 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighed 210 to 220 pounds when he was in his 50's, Dr. Schwartz said, and descriptions indicate he had the well-muscled thighs and calves of a horseman and strong neck muscles. Part of the project includes measuring clothing Washington wore for clues about bodily dimensions, and determining how the style and cut of the clothing may have affected his outward appearance. After the look of Washington at age 53 is fixed, then comes the hard part. ''It's harder to go from old to young because of the many changes people undergo when they age,'' Dr. Schwartz said. Typically when people age, he said, they grow cartilage in the face, which lengthens noses and ear lobes while losing fat in their cheeks. ''We have to find ways to put that back as we reverse the process,'' he said. An obvious problem about Washington is his teeth, which he began losing in his 20's. By the time he was 53, he had only one natural tooth left and had spent most of his adulthood with a series of partial and full dentures, which would have affected the shape of his mouth and jaw through the loss of gum and bone, Dr. Schwartz said. For instance, in the famous Gilbert Stuart portrait of Washington, used on the dollar bill, the researchers speculate that the square-jaw appearance may result from iron springs at the back of his dentures pushing out. Once the team settles on its images of Washington by early next summer, its computer data will be used to drive milling machines at Studio EIS in New York City to make replicas from high-density foam that will be used to make molds for the final figures. Then sculptors and artists will add hair, coloring and clothing to the multi-aged Washingtons to have them ready for public viewing when Mount Vernon's new visitor complex opens at the end of 2006 to reintroduce Americans to the father of their country.", "title": "Makeover to Depict Washington as Young, Old and In Between"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/United States", "Top/News", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Virginia", "Top/News/U.S./South", "Top/News/Science", "Top/News/Health", "Top/News/Technology", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Activities and Interests/History", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Banking, Finance and Insurance", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Technology, Telecommunications and Internet", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Virginia"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Technology; Science; Health", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Science Desk", "print_page_number": "3", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "F", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/science/02geor.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "02GEOR$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "THE CLAIM: Identical twins have identical fingerprints. THE FACTS: Identical twins often share personality traits, interests and habits. They come from the same fertilized egg and share the same genetic blueprint. To a standard DNA test, they are indistinguishable. But any forensics  expert will tell you that there is at least one surefire way to tell them  apart: identical twins do not have matching fingerprints. Like physical appearance and personality, fingerprints are largely shaped by a persons DNA and by a variety of environmental forces. Genetics helps determine the general patterns on a fingertip, which appear as arches, loops and whorls. An individual finger can have just one of these patterns or a mixture of them. While a fetus is developing, the ridges along these patterns are influenced by a number of factors, including bone growth, pressures within the womb and contact with amniotic fluid. These lead to unique ridge characteristics in each person and finger, said Gary W. Jones, a former fingerprint specialist with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Often, identical twins will have a similar arrangement of patterns, but never the same minute details. ''It's impossible for people to have identical fingerprints,'' said Mr.  Jones, who now works as a private consultant in Summerfield, Fla. ''The study of fingerprints has been around for about 100 years, and in all that time, two people have never been found to have the same prints.'' The patterns on a person's fingers, palms and feet are fully formed by roughly the fifth month of pregnancy. They stay the same throughout life, barring any changes brought on by severe mutilation or a skin disease. But even then, they change very little. John Dillinger, the notorious Depression-era gangster, famously tried to alter his facial features and obliterate his fingerprints with acid to elude authorities. After Dillinger died, experts discerned a few of his remaining ridge patterns and identified him easily. THE BOTTOM LINE: Identical twins never have matching fingerprints.

Two proposed dams were never built, but Glen Canyon dam, located in an unprotected area, was completed in 1963. Over the next 17 years, water backed up for 186 miles, forming Lake Powell and inundating Glen Canyon and hundreds of miles of side canyons. The defeat was deeply felt. David Brower, who was executive director of the Sierra Club, called the death of Glen Canyon the greatest disappointment of his life. Edward Abbey, the mischievous author and defender of the natural world, called Glen Canyon the ''living heart'' of the Colorado River and Lake Powell a ''blue death.'' He often spoke of floating a houseboat filled with explosives to the base of the dam to get rid of ''Lake Foul.'' What Mr. Abbey and the Sierra Club couldn't or didn't do nature has now accomplished. A severe Western drought -- some say the worst in 500 years -- is shrinking Lake Powell at the rate of up to a foot every four days. Since 1999, the vast reservoir has lost more than 60 percent of its water. Glen Canyon is returning. It is open and viewable in much of its former glory. At the confluence of Coyote Creek and Escalante River, where boaters once motored by to see famous rock formations, backpackers now pick their way up a shallow river channel. Fifteen-foot high cottonwoods grow amid thickets of willow, gamble oak and tamarisk. Where fish thrived, mountain lions prowl. The change may be permanent. ''Short of several back-to-back years with 100-year runoff, Lake Powell will never be full again,'' said Dr. Tom Myers, a hydrologic consultant in Reno, Nev. Downstream users now consume 16.5 million acre-feet of water, but on average only 15 million acre-feet flow into the system each year, he said. Add more than a million acre-feet of water lost to evaporation and it is obvious that only during relatively wet years is it possible to add water. The struggles over Glen Canyon and the other dams on the Colorado River above the Grand Canyon were among the battles that led to the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act and clean air and water legislation. Among these successes, the dam was a defeat that has not been forgotten. In 1981 the radical environmental group Earth First! unfurled a 300-foot-long sheet of plastic shaped like a crack down the dam's face. Now, Dr. Richard Ingebretsen, a physician and founder of the Glen Canyon Institute in Salt Lake City, a group dedicated to draining Lake Powell and restoring Glen Canyon to its natural state, says: ''The drought is a godsend. Now is the chance for us to have the national debate we didn't have 40 years ago. With the lake so low, people can see what was lost, the life cycles, the ecosystem. There is a powerful beauty here that can change people's minds.'' The changes are stunning. When it was full five years ago, the lake had 250 square miles of flat water and thousands of miles of fractal shoreline. Each year, two and a half million people came to enjoy vacations with boating, swimming, fishing. The lake was rimmed by a starkly beautiful landscape; filmmakers shot movies like ''Planet of the Apes'' and ''The Greatest Story Ever Told.'' Today the lake is down 129 feet, back to the size it was in 1970, covering 131 square miles. Canyon walls are plastered with a chalky white bathtub ring of calcium carbonate 10 stories high, where the water once reached. Towering benches of silt line the former lake bed. This year 1.8 million visitors are expected. ''The lake is still beautiful,'' said Char Obergh, an information officer for the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in Page, Ariz. ''People can see more features than ever with the water low.'' Paul Ostapuk, a spokesman for Friends of Lake Powell in Page, said: ''Droughts are a regular part of the Colorado River. The lake draws down and it fills up again.'' In the meantime, he said, families can still get together on the lake for a wonderful time. In two years, depending on the weather, Lake Powell could reach what hydrologists call inactive pool, meaning the water stored in the lake will not produce enough flow to generate hydroelectric power. A year or two after that, water could drop another 120 feet. At that point, because of the steepness of canyon walls at the dam, Lake Powell would still have two million acre feet of water spanning 32 square miles, offering continued recreation opportunities. At that same point, hundreds of miles of side canyons would emerge into sunlight offering backpackers a chance to see what was lost. In an expedition down the Colorado River in 1869, John Wesley Powell provided English names for dozens of features like Tapestry Wall, 1,000-foot-high sand dunes frozen into rock and stained with veils of black desert varnish, and Music Temple, a vast grotto of sinuous stone where a person could hum a note for one second and still hear it resonating 11 seconds later. Canyons that would be exposed include Dungeon, Labyrinth, Anasazi, Iceberg, Moki, Last Chance, Mystery Rock, Hidden Passage, Twilight and Lost Eden. Already some features are back, including a stretch of Imperial rapids and a Native American sarcophagus that once held a mummy, now stored in a nearby museum. But the side canyons are the real miracles of Glen Canyon, said Chris Peterson, executive director of the Glen Canyon Institute who started revisiting the Escalante River at Coyote Creek in 1999. That year the lake was down only a short distance, he said, but a riot of plants had sprung to life overnight. Dr. David Wegner, an expert on canyon ecology and the president of Ecosystem Management International in Durango, Colo., explained why. First, most side canyons are made of porous Navajo sandstone, which has acted like a huge sponge for 30 years. As the reservoir drops, the stone can't drain as quickly. That water steadily trickles out, feeding the desert ecosystem. Second, the retreating lake leaves sediment loaded with nutrients. Seeds that fall germinate quickly in the shade. Insects, amphibians and birds come back followed by rodents, raccoons, deer and panthers. Glen Canyon has been called a lost Eden, largely because the conditions are perfect for life. The side canyons, with deep shade and sculptured grottoes, were always the ecological pump for much of the life in the Grand Canyon and beyond, Dr. Wegner said. Last spring Mr. Peterson and his colleagues began leading small groups down the Escalante River to see the recovery firsthand. This fall, trekkers can walk 15 miles downriver, barefoot, marveling at the sights, sounds and smells. To everyone's surprise, the bathtub ring is disappearing rapidly. Summer monsoons are washing it away. There is very little human garbage in the shin-deep river that runs through the old lake bed. On a recent exploration, hikers saw only a plastic bucket and a bottle. The air smells sweet. Clear springs flow out of newly exposed rock. The river bottom is the consistency of confectioner's sugar, a very soft silt that is prone to form pockets of quicksand. As attractive as the exposed canyon is, hiking there can be challenging. It is already possible to explore small side canyons. Scrambling up and into one of these grottoes is to enter a world of haunting beauty. Out on the river, the air is hot and dry. Suddenly the world turns cool, dark, quiet. Sheer and curved walls of red, orange and ocher-colored rock hold hanging gardens of maidenhair ferns. There are datura often painted by Georgia O'Keeffe, along with orchids, scarlet monkey flowers and cave primrose. One recent visitor, Alvin Colville, a retired rancher from Del Norte, Colo., first came to Glen Canyon in 1962 when he was 31. ''These side canyons are what called me back,'' he said, hoisting a pack onto his back. ''They're small, cozy, quiet, magnificent. In many places you could touch both walls. The sky was a little blue slot up above.'' Harry Garabedian and Betsey McNaughten of Deering, N.H., were also on the Escalante River recently on a weeklong hiking trip. ''It's beautiful to watch the full moon bounce up over the cliff tops,'' Mr. Garabedian said. But the lakeshore bears witness to recent years. ''Every rock you turn over has toilet paper under it from the years this was a campsite for boats.'' Mr. Peterson said there was one side canyon farther downstream that he could hardly wait to visit on foot. The size of two football fields, overhung with glowing orange and red rock, Cathedral Canyon is perhaps the most famous lost feature in Glen Canyon. To Edward Abbey it was grander than all the cathedrals in Europe. It was a place where he expected to see ''a rainbow colored corona of blazing light, pure spirit, pure being, pure disembodied intelligence, about to speak my name.'' Five years ago it was under 140 feet of water; now, just 18. Last year it had a waterfall five feet high. This summer a monsoon cleared out silt so that the waterfall is now 20 feet high. If it is speaking Mr. Abbey's name it is whispering now, but if the water keeps receding, it may soon be shouting.", "title": "Drought Unearths a Buried Treasure"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Colorado", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Utah", "Top/News/U.S./Rockies", "Top/News/U.S./Southwest", "Top/News/Science", "Top/News/Health", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Activities and Interests/National Parks", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Utah", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Utah/Salt Lake City"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Science; Health", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Science Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "F", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/science/earth/02cany.html", "print_column": "5", "slug": "02CANY$02"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Yet another species barrier has been broken. Chimpanzees have been videotaped with tool kits. Not just sticks, mind you, but three different kinds of sticks for different purposes, some modified (by chewing on the end, for instance) to make them more efficient. We've known for a while that some other species, like the great apes and crows, use rudimentary tools, but just as a few adjectives are not the same as a sonnet, one stick does not a tool kit make. I know what I'm talking about. For someone who doesn't do much work around the house, I have a lot of tools. I've always felt that this was a kind of tribute to my evolutionary heritage. Tool use is a defining characteristic of the human lineage and, I tell those who wonder why I can't use the wrenches we already have to fix the faucets, I'm every bit as human as all the other people I see shopping for pipe wrenches and pipe on Saturday morning. I have the regular hammers and screwdrivers and electric drills, of course, all of which I used extensively when I tried, over the course of the summer to rehang a screen door. I didn't succeed, but using tools is what makes you human. Nobody ever said you had to be good at it. I also have a variety of tools that are remnants of old habits and interests, like the vintage drawknives I bought on eBay when I was carving yew staves into long bows (a lot easier than hanging a screen door.) But, no matter what others may say, the point here is not that I have spent a lot of money accumulating a lot of tools that I don't use much any more. The point is that when I'm waiting in the endless line at the home improvement store with the other humans and their tools, it makes me feel like I'm really part of something special, Homo sapiens -- the only creature that buys random orbital sanders. One can't ignore these new tool collecting apes, however. In the current issue of The American Naturalist three researchers have published ''New Insights Into Chimpanzees, Tools and Termites From the Congo Basin.'' Crickette Sanz of Washington University in St. Louis and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany; Dave Morgan of Cambridge University and the Wildlife Conservation Society; and Steve Gulick of Wildland Security used remote cameras set at termite mounds to get hours of videotape of chimps catching and eating termites. The chimps in the videos have three tools, a heavy puncturing stick, a lighter perforating stick and a light, flexible fishing stick. A chimp heading to a subterranean mound of termites will bring a strong puncturing stick and a lighter fishing stick. A chimp going to a mound above ground will use a lighter-weight perforating stick and an even lighter one to fish with. When the colonies are underground the chimps first poke the strong puncturing stick into the ground, with hands and one foot, looking for all the world like gardeners using a spade. For an above-ground mound the chimps use a lighter stick to punch holes in the mound. The researchers call this a perforating stick. When the puncturing or perforating is done the chimps sit down by a hole they've made and use the lightweight fishing stick, which has one end crushed to make a sort of brush. As the termites rush to the breach, the chimp dips the fishing stick into the mound, pulls it out with termites clinging to it, and lips them off. As they are feeding the chimps look like browsers at a buffet spearing shrimp, with slightly distracted but self-satisfied faces. That, however, is not a cultural breakthrough. No one who has been to a buffet table would characterize the human behavior that occurs there as evolutionarily advanced. There is likely to be some academic dispute about whether these are true tool kits or perhaps something else, like fishing equipment. Perhaps. They might be more similar to garden tools than carpenter's tools, which means I suppose that chimps are headed toward a Smith & Hawken-based material culture. Mind you, I'm not saying that chimps are truly human. People not only use tools, they develop a desire for them in and of themselves, apart from their usefulness. When I order a vintage Yankee screwdriver online or buy an old drawknife on eBay because the steel takes an edge well, I'm indulging myself. To use tools is human, to buy from the Garrett Wade catalog is making a fetish of a simple enterprise. Maybe having fetishes is what sets us apart from the other animals. No one has ever seen a chimp, in the wild, in Manolo Blahnik shoes with ice pick toes, even though they might be just the thing for perforating termite mounds. Not yet. That's a videotape I will have to see. SIDE EFFECTS", "title": "I Drill; Therefore, I Am.

The DreamWorks DVD release has been cleverly packaged with an elaborate talking menu that gives you even more riffs from Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers and a few of the other voice actors, as well as a generous selection of promotional videos and outtakes. The latter section includes some technical glitches that give an interesting look at the nuts and bolts of computer animation, of which ''Shrek 2'' remains a polished if not innovative example. The big addition to this sequel to the vastly successful 2001 ''Shrek'' is a new character, a crafty, continental Puss in Boots voiced, very expressively, by Antonio Banderas. Otherwise the film, directed by Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon, replays the same winning blend of pop-culture references, inside Hollywood jokes (a few more Disneylike characters are skewered by the executive producer and former Disney honcho Jeffrey Katzenberg), and fairy-tale archetypes reconfigured as fables of self-esteem. Three more years of technological development in computer animation make it possible to give the characters new, more realistic skin textures, including razor stubble for both Shrek and his bride. 2004. $29.99.

With 60 full-length cartoons from the golden age of Warner animation, plus a mountain of supplementary material, it is awfully hard to hit the stop button even long enough to run to the refrigerator. Like the first volume in the series, released in 2003, this set features stunning new Technicolor restorations of these eight-minute wonders, many with commentary tracks from academics like Greg Ford and Michael Barrier. (The ''Ren and Stimpy'' creator John Kricfalusi comments on one film as well.) A few classics missing from Volume 1 appear here, including ''One Froggy Evening'' and ''What's Opera, Doc?,'', along with glorious obscurities like Tex Avery's maddeningly catchy ''I Love to Singa'' and the black-and-white original version of Bob Clampett's extreme animation ''Porky in Wackyland.'' Mr. Clampett, somewhat neglected in favor of the great Chuck Jones in Volume 1, gets his due here, with other fine examples of his almost frighteningly anarchic style in ''Kitty Kornered,'' ''Book Revue'' and ''A Corny Concerto,'' his devastating parody of ''Fantasia'' with Elmer Fudd as Stokowski (''Welcome, music wovers!''). $64.92. G. 'Animal Farm' Rounding out a big week for cartoons, Home Vision Entertainment offers the 1954 British animated film of George Orwell's anti-totalitarian fable. The film, directed in an acceptable pseudo-Disney style by Joy Batchelor and John Halas, was in the news last year when it was revealed that the C.I.A. had secretly financed the production, purchasing the rights to the novel from Orwell's widow and arranging for the newsreel producer Louis de Rochemont to manage its making. Aimed at adults, who it was hoped would be persuaded to vote Tory after experiencing the film's porcine version of socialism (yes, some pigs are still more equal than others), it is hardly a film to charm today's children, heavy as it is with rhetorical red scares. But as a missing chapter in the underground history of the cold war it's compelling viewing. $24.95. Not rated. 'The More the Merrier' The director George Stevens is doomed to be remembered for the stodgy epics he made in the 1950's: heavy slabs of granite titled ''Shane'' and ''Giant,'' among others. But his best work is found in the intimate, leisurely paced comedy-dramas he made during World War II, including the wonderful 1943 romantic comedy ''The More the Merrier.'' Set during the wartime housing shortage in Washington, the film centers on an uptight government secretary (the troubled Jean Arthur, here looking leggier and sexier than in any of her other films) who advertises for a female roommate and finds herself saddled with a retired business tycoon (Charles Coburn) and a dashing young Army Air Force engineer (Joel McCrea). With Coburn playing fairy godfather, the two young people plow through a string of comic collisions that lead to genuine affection. Though Stevens trained as a cameraman, his greatest strength was his editing. He had an idiosyncratic and effective sense of how long individual shots should run, never simply cutting on dialogue exchanges but on the small emotional breakthroughs that underlie the characters' banter. Nowhere is his technique better illustrated than in this film's celebrated front-stoop sequence, in which Arthur and McCrea sit down for a chat and find themselves suddenly overwhelmed by their need for each other. In six precisely framed shots Stevens defines the exact moment when physical attraction suddenly turns into something more -- that quality old movies unabashedly defined as love. Regrettably, Columbia TriStar Home Video has released this film, one of the absolute gems of its library, in a transfer taken from a worn and contrasty print, with no extras to fill out the disc.

Parvez Sharma, a New York-based director, has been worried that much worse could await the Muslim homosexuals profiled in his upcoming ''In the Name of Allah,'' if ever they were identified. For some, imprisonment or torture is a possibility, Mr. Sharma said. Indeed, one of Mr. Sharma's associate producers, a gay Egyptian man, will not be listed in the credits at his own request because of the perceived risk. And threats to the director have become routine. ''About every two weeks I get an e-mail that berates me, condemns me to hell and, if they are nice, asks me to still seek forgiveness while there is still time,'' Mr. Sharma said, speaking here about his as yet unfinished film, which he is preparing to take on the festival circuit in faraway 2006. That such pressure is building around a project still more than a year from completion is the best measure of a perhaps widening gulf that separates an increasingly open attitude toward gay and lesbian life in many Western countries from that of predominantly Muslim ones. With backing primarily from European television broadcasters, including Channel 4 in Britain, Arte in France and ZDF in Germany, Mr. Sharma set out nearly two years ago to examine how homosexual Muslims around the world reconciled their faith with their sexual orientation. In doing so, the director received advice and moral support from his producer, Sandi Simcha DuBowski, the filmmaker behind ''Trembling Before G-d,'' a feature-length documentary that two years ago investigated the lives of Orthodox and Hasidic Jews who are also gay or lesbian. ''Parvez's film is extremely important,'' Mr. DuBowski said. ''It challenges the idea that there are no Muslim gays or lesbians. It poses much the same question that 'Trembling Before G-d' did: why would gays want to be part of a tradition that rejects them?'' Mr. Sharma, who was born and brought up in India, said the inspiration for his film came from his own experiences as a gay Muslim. His curiosity about how Islam and homosexuality intersect grew when he attended American University in Washington, where he received a master's degree in film and video. Listening to stories told by gay Muslims at the school, Mr. Sharma conceived the idea of a picture that would ''give voice to a community that really needed to be heard and that until now hadn't been; it was about going where the silence was strongest.'' Mr. Sharma has conducted interviews throughout North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East, in countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Egypt. Many of the people he interviewed were found through the Internet. ''I received thousands of e-mails shortly after word got out about the film,'' Mr. Sharma said. ''One 17-year-old Egyptian is remarkably brave, quite open about his sexual orientation despite that country's crackdown on homosexuals.'' As with Christianity and Judaism, there is a broad range of expert opinion on the exact nature of Islam's official stance toward homosexuality. Some scholars interpret the Koran as suggesting that there is no condemnation of homosexuality, while others read Muslim scripture as indicating homosexual acts should be punished with death. Given the hostility toward homosexuality in some Islamic factions, Mr. Sharma has gone to great lengths to reassure many of his interview subjects that they will remain anonymous. But this obscuring of identities has led to what the director regards as one of his key challenges: filming people in silhouette or with their faces covered tends to reinforce a sense of shame around homosexuality, precisely countering one of Mr. Sharma's main objectives. ''One young Afghan woman I've interviewed, if her family found out about her being lesbian they would undoubtedly kill her,'' Mr. Sharma said. ''So it's unavoidable. In certain circumstances, I'm going to have to conceal faces. But I'd rather not.'' Still, nothing in that difficult process -- including the threats to himself -- has destroyed Mr. Sharma's faith in the ability of Islam to tolerate diversity. ''You have to understand,'' Mr. Sharma said, ''that Islam is a religion of more than a billion people, one more than 13 centuries old, that has been hijacked by an extremely small and sometimes loud minority.''", "title": "Act of Faith: A Film on Gays and Islam"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/Features/Arts", "Top/Features/Movies", "Top/Features/Movies/News and Features", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Media, Entertainment and Publishing"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Movies; Arts", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "print_page_number": "3", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "E", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/movies/02alla.html", "print_column": "4", "slug": "02ALLA$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Hermeto Pascoal was like a mad professor -- part cerebral, part zany -- when he performed at the Allen Room of Jazz at Lincoln Center on Friday night. Mr. Pascoal has been a well-known musician in his native Brazil since the 1960's, and a band member and composer for Miles Davis's 1970 album ''Live/Evil.'' He has written music for conventional and unconventional ensembles, from orchestras to jazz combos to animal sounds to found instruments, cheerfully mingling melody and noise. With his long white hair and beard and his cartoon-bright clothes, Mr. Pascoal was both composer and clown at the Allen Room. He walked on stage tootling on two water bottles, and he performed '''Round Midnight'' with a trumpet mouthpiece on the spout of a teakettle. Then his group joined him, and the music turned more complex and premeditated. From his huge inventory of compositions, Mr. Pascoal chose pieces with modernist harmonies and extended melodies, like Stravinsky and Wayne Shorter via Brazil. The tunes, stated with boundless joviality by Vinicius Dorin on saxophones, took all sorts of zigzag paths, often setting out a long line and then repeating it. While that method sometimes grew schematic, the rhythm section never did. Andre Pereira Marques on piano, Mr. Dorin on saxophones, Fabio da Silva Pascoal on percussion and Marcio Villa Bahia on drums batted around thick chords and endless rhythmic crossfire. They could swing with the limber intensity of mid-1960's jazz or hurtle toward free-jazz furors, and they were also in touch with Brazilian rhythms like samba and bai\u00e3o. Partway through the set, the quintet bounced pairs of metal tubes against the floor in syncopations that suggested African balafon music sent to carnival. The quintet, joined by an unannounced female singer who scat-sang alongside the saxophone, played much of the set with Mr. Pascoal simply supervising. When he did join in, it was usually as a jester: making his keyboard play sampled barks and meows, turning his voice into rasps and whoops as he sang with his keyboard solo, leading an audience singalong. Mr. Pascoal's music encompasses sizable bodies of knowledge -- jazz, European classical music, Brazilian pop -- but he's happy to make it sound like playtime. Cyro Baptista's Beat the Donkey, which opened the show, had a larger arsenal of junk and instruments. The 11 musicians deployed an international assortment of percussion -- along with occasional guitar, saxophone and keyboard -- for a set of songs and rhythm workouts that covered Brazil, the Americas and beyond. When members seated themselves before tuned gongs to play gamelan music, an Indonesian dancer in full costume appeared; there was also tap dancing and the acrobatics of Brazilian capoeira. In silly hats and motley costumes, Beat the Donkey had showmanship and timing to match its globe-hopping rhythms.

Yet this dynamic film is based on Ian McEwan's ambiguous, interior, apparently unadaptable novel. Just imagine all the bad movies that might have come from that. How the book became the film, without costing the novel its soul, is the story of a collaboration that doesn't even sound promising. There's a director who leaves few fingerprints, Roger Michell; a screenwriter best known as a playwright, Joe Penhall; and a novelist who realizes that, as Mr. McEwan put it in a phone conversation last week, ''translating a novel to film is an act of controlled vandalism.'' True, Mr. McEwan's 1997 novel has some splashy cinema-ready touches, like the stalker plot and the balloon accident that begins both the book and the film. Joe and Jed meet when they and a few other men try to bring down an out-of-control hot-air balloon with a small boy in its basket. Dangling by its ropes until they are forced to let go, the men drop into a field as the bright red balloon sails away and one of the good Samaritans falls to his death. The film (which opened on Friday in Manhattan and Los Angeles) makes the most of this visual drama. Yet at heart ''Enduring Love'' is a first-person novel about Joe's inner life. In the book, he tortures himself wondering whether he might have been the first to let go of the rope. His marriage crumbles under the weight of his agonizing about the accident and the stalker, a near stranger who loves him obsessively and believes Joe loves him too. Joe, a science writer, eventually diagnoses Jed's mental disorder and sees his ''pathological love'' as a ''dark, distorting mirror'' that might reveal its healthier counterpart, ''the nature of love itself.'' This lyrical observation offers a key to much of Mr. McEwan's fiction, in which aberrations like incest, sadomasochism and murder help explain the normal love most people seek. But the novel is loaded with problems for a screenwriter. One awful film version would have been talky and dull; another would have been nothing more than a slasher movie. Mr. McEwan had no interest in writing the script himself, although he was asked. He once spent three years of his life on the screenplay of another of his books, ''The Innocent,'' set in cold-war Berlin, only to see it become a tepid movie and a commercial failure (even if it did have Anthony Hopkins as the star and John Schlesinger as director). After that, he swore off adapting his own work. ''There's always a problem; you want to hug the book closely,'' he said of the novelist's impulse as screenwriter. ''I thought the best thing was to let Roger make it his.'' When Mr. Michell began developing the film several years ago, he was also directing Mr. Penhall's ''Blue/Orange'' at the National Theater in London. Although Mr. Penhall is scarcely known here, he is considered one of Britain's hot youngish playwrights. (He's 37.) ''Blue/Orange,'' which won a slew of awards in England, is set in a mental hospital, and an earlier play, ''Some Voices,'' dealt with the treatment of the mentally ill, so ''I'd inadvertently researched it quite well,'' Mr. Penhall said of ''Enduring Love.'' As Mr. Michell and Mr. Penhall reshaped the book, the questions they addressed amount to a handbook for literary adaptation. Some changes were tiny and practical: Joe's wife, Clarissa, a Keats scholar in the novel, in the movie became his girlfriend, Claire, a sculptor. Her new profession is more visual and her new name, ''more democratic'' as Mr. Penhall said. Joe became a teacher instead of a science writer, which gives him an excuse to lecture his students on the nature of love instead of talking to the reader. And the camera sticks almost exclusively to Joe's point of view, substituting for the first-person narrative. A bigger challenge, Mr. Penhall said, was deciding ''how to dramatize Joe's internal conflict.'' ''I thought the best way was to show how it manifested itself with his partner, Claire,'' he said, ''using things that are alluded to in the book -- how his relationship began to fall apart and how his behavior became more and more erratic.'' That shifted the emphasis away from Joe's questioning (philosophy and movies rarely go together) and onto his relationships with Claire and Jed, which the film captures in all their fraught and finally violent crisscrossings. In the past, Mr. Michell has often seemed the invisible director. ''Notting Hill,'' written by Richard Curtis, (who wrote and directed ''Love Actually'') seems like a Richard Curtis film. ''Changing Lanes, '' the Ben Affleck-Samuel L. Jackson thriller, could have been made by any of half a dozen competent directors in Hollywood. But in ''Enduring Love'' the confrontations are staged and the characters revealed with a visual eloquence missing from Mr. Michell's earlier work. Mr. McEwan, as associate producer, didn't entirely get out of the filmmakers' way. As they say in Hollywood, he gave notes. Among other things, he persuaded Mr. Penhall and Mr. Michell to restore Jed's religious obsession, which an early version of the screenplay had eliminated. Mr. Penhall said of Jed's religious fervor: ''I was nervous it might come across on film as a clich\u00e9.'' Jed's religion, milder on screen than in the novel, ''has a lovely strangeness now,'' Mr. Penhall added. ''He's not evangelical, not fire and brimstone. He believes in God's love.'' Yet Mr. McEwan knows that the film ''Enduring Love'' is not his. ''The role of the novelist mustn't be to hover around the project like its bad conscience,'' he said, an approach he has carried over to the film adaptation of his last book, ''Atonement.'' That novel may be even more difficult to translate because its plot about love and lies in the World War II era is wrapped in layers of storytelling. Richard Eyre is planning to direct the film and Christopher Hampton is writing the script.

Kauffman  Illustrated. 508 pages. Random House. $29.95. ''Sic semper tyrannis!'' is the battle cry forever linked to the man who assassinated President Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theater in Washington. It is less traditional to remember John Wilkes Booth as a man who told his sister: ''Don't let us be sad. Life is so short -- and the world is so beautiful. Just to breathe is delicious.'' This is not to suggest that ''American Brutus,'' Michael W. Kauffman's forensically precise, eerily prescient account of Booth's activities, favors the killer's sensitive side. It simply indicates the extent to which Mr. Kauffman's portrait is surprising. It presents a canny, willful Booth who shaped a far-reaching plot and went to elaborate lengths to entrap his fellow conspirators -- ''a manipulator, not a pawn.'' And Booth's scheme, as this book intricately reconstructs it, involved much more careful, long-range calculation than has previously been acknowledged. Is there new information to be found here? No detail of the Lincoln assassination has been too minor to prompt historians' furor. Woe to the author who, like Jim Bishop in ''The Day Lincoln Was Shot,'' described the scene around Lincoln's deathbed and made the mistake of attributing tiptoeing to Corp. James Tanner, who lost his feet at the Battle of Bull Run. In this hotly contentious atmosphere, amid evidence that has been endlessly picked over, there may be no major revelations left to discover. But Mr. Kauffman seriously challenges conventional wisdom. He develops a different vantage point just by bringing present-day investigative tactics and perspective to events of the past. And he draws parallels with unsettling ease. He describes rampant terror, fears about biological warfare (a purported scheme to spread clothing carrying yellow fever) and angry invective aimed at the wartime president (''this man of yesterday, this Abraham Lincoln, that neither you nor I ever heard of four years ago,'' one senator said of him). He cites complaints that the secretary of state, William H. Seward, nearly killed in a grisly assault simultaneous with the shooting of Lincoln, secretly wielded more authority than the president did. He tells how the president's wartime legal measures impinged upon civil liberties and how especially unpopular that made him in Maryland, where much of Booth's plot was hatched. And he writes of the harsh treatment of prisoners. ''It is not easy to put aside the barbarous image of people in hoods and chains,'' he writes. ''Prisoners had not been treated that way since 1696 and would not be again until 2001.'' In revisiting this atmosphere, Mr. Kauffman brings a weird whiff of method acting to the biographer's role. ''It was an interactive affair and required personal involvement,'' says the writer, who participated in the burial of one last assassination artifact (a conspirator's skull, accidentally found in the Smithsonian) and has been giving guided bus tours of Booth's escape route for nearly 20 years. Whether or not it was essential for him to have followed Booth's path so closely (''I've even burned down a tobacco barn like the one in which Booth was trapped''), his attachment to this material is palpable. And it yields a riveting, newly immediate view of a nation in turmoil. While Booth is the book's central figure, he is by no means its only focus. To be sure, Mr. Kauffman gives full attention to the Booth family's history (including a joking threat by the patriarch, the actor Junius Brutus Booth, to kill his friend, President Andrew Jackson). And he demolishes the idea that John Wilkes Booth's unsuccessful acting career contributed to the bitterness that made him an assassin. In his view Booth was well reviewed, widely employed and as popular in Boston as he was in Confederate cities. He was also enough of a heartthrob to endanger handsome men throughout the nation. Many were summarily arrested and some even made victims of mob violence because in an age before instantly available photography, they were mistaken for Lincoln's killer. But ''American Brutus'' also re-examines Booth's plan for many subordinate figures -- most of whom, Mr. Kauffman says, thought they were participating only in a scheme to kidnap Lincoln and cooperated to avenge the treatment of captive Confederate soldiers. In addition to involving a surprisingly large group of people, the strategy also incorporated horses. The equine factor provides some of Mr. Kauffman's most startling insights into Booth's thinking. Horses rented from public stables were widely used by the conspirators. Mr. Kauffman demonstrates that these stables, rather than the boarding house of Mary Surratt (the first American woman to be given the death penalty), were the plotters' primary meeting places. And Booth apparently made sure that a long trail of horse-related evidence was public and visible. He did his best to implicate others to keep them from testifying against him, in accordance with the laws of that era. Indeed, ''President Andrew Johnson had been compromised by a small card left in his hotel mailbox, and the false impression it gave of intimacy with Booth would haunt him for the rest of his career.'' Taken individually, each such instance of ''suspicious'' behavior (as Mr. Kauffman annoyingly describes behavior that is suspect) is relatively small. But their combined effect is potent. It yields a vital, fascinating glimpse of American history at its most turbulent, and it transports the reader viscerally back to those frantic, uncertain times. These were the last moments when presidential assassination was unthinkable, when the White House needed guards only to keep tourists from stealing drapes, when a killer could gain access to his prey by presenting a calling card. Perhaps they were also the last moments when an assassin could regard his motives as strictly noble. That kind of innocence, like so many others, ended with Wilkes's lethal bullet. ''Useless. Useless.'' Those were his last and, if not best-remembered, still his most enduring words.

Now, a year after the Infosys Technologies (Shanghai) Company was set up, the venture center has 200 employees and 4 multinational customers. Infosys, the Bangalore-based software services company, and other top Indian outsourcing rivals, including Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro Technologies, are doing application development and maintenance work in China as they grow rapidly to keep up with booming demand from the West for their services. And they are quickly concluding that only China has a worker base equal to India's in terms of cost, quality and scale. Expansion there also offers the ability to cater to -- and possibly garner more of -- the local and regional markets, including Japan. Vigorous global demand -- revenue from India's information technology exports was $12.5 billion in the year ended in March, up 30 percent from the previous year -- has resulted in a 10 percent to 15 percent annual rise in wages in India's software and back-office services industry. According to a KPMG study for the National Association of Software and Services Companies, or Nasscom, an industry trade group in India, the country will face an acute shortage of technical employees by 2009, falling short by about 250,000 workers. ''We need a deep reservoir of talent as well as an alternative low-cost center like India as we continue to grow,'' said Nandan Nilekani, chief executive of Infosys, who has talked of his company's scaling up to become the Wal-Mart of outsourcing. ''And only China can match up.'' In the quarter ended in September, Infosys alone added more than 5,000 employees, for a total of nearly 33,000. And Wipro added 5,500 employees, reaching more than 36,000. As Indian companies have looked for skilled workers outside the country for software development and customer support centers, some have ventured into Mexico and Eastern Europe. But many say that China holds the most promise, in part because of its potential as a rival. Though its software export revenues were just $700 million in 2003, ''China will soon be competing with India as an outsourcing destination,'' said the Singapore-based Girija Pande, director for Asia Pacific of Tata Consultancy, India's top software services exporter. It set up operations in China in 2002. And a presence now, these companies say, positions them to grab such future business. Entry into the country is made easier by the ability to piggyback onto the existing base of customers with interests in China. ''With China's economy swelling so quickly, multinationals are looking for global software firms who already understand their standards and systems,'' Mr. Pande said. Tata Consultancy, for instance, is working in China with its longtime customer, General Electric. China has some 200,000 information technology workers -- compared with India's 850,000 -- in 6,000 local companies, according to some estimates. More than 50,000 Chinese software programmers are being added to this pool annually. Some important ingredients that have made India a formidable global software services exporter are in place in China as well, like the high value put on education and a focus on engineering in higher education. The Chinese government is sweetening the deal for the Indian concerns, as well as for global competitors like Accenture and I.B.M. Global Services, by offering high-quality infrastructure at low costs and offering alliances with local universities to recruit Chinese talent. China also offers Indian outsourcing concerns a low employee turnover rate. For instance, Tata Consultancy's staff turnover in China is less than 6 percent a year, compared with 15 percent in its Indian operations. The company says it may double the number of employees in China in the next 18 months from its current 180. For now, however, even with wages rising in India, China's information technology workers are more expensive ''because a combination of English-language and technical skills is at a premium,'' Mr. Nilekani of Infosys said. According to Mr. Pande of Tata, the wage differential is about 12 to 15 percent. So while an entry-level programmer in India might earn $125 a month, a Chinese equivalent might earn $142 to $147. The managerial talent differential is even bigger. And scalability -- the ability to grow quickly when circumstances warrant -- is posing a challenge because of the scarcity of good English speakers and experienced managers in China. While even second-tier Indian software companies have 12,000 to 15,000 employees, only a handful of Chinese software companies have more than 3,000. When NIIT, India's top technology training company, set up by the founder of the software exporter HCL Technologies, made exploratory moves in China in 1997, it was a toss-up between setting up a software services unit or a training one. ''Available skills were so low that we went into training,'' said Prakash Menon, president of NIIT China, who opened NIIT's first training center in Shanghai in 1998. The company now has 121 centers in 25 provinces and trains 25,000 Chinese annually. Wipro set up its China unit in August to develop software and maintain it for the company's global clients in the United States, Europe and Japan. Though Wipro aims to expand the unit to 200 employees next year from 10 now, projects that require a high level of management skills are unlikely to be done there soon, said Masaki Nagao, Wipro's chief executive for Japan and China operations. Mr. Nilekani of Infosys says he expects that this will change. ''In three to four years, cost and scale will be two top reasons to be there,'' he said. At least for now, however, some Indian companies are choosing not to take the plunge. ''Though it is fashionable to be in China, we are skeptical'' about the need to move there, said Saurav Adhikari, vice president for corporate strategy at HCL Technologies. There is enough potential to expand in markets where the company already has operations, he said, including India, the United States and Japan. For those that do move into China, said Mr. Menon of NIIT the eventual model would be to hire Chinese programmers and Indian managers, and set up operations in low-cost centers just outside high-cost business hubs like Shanghai. Some companies are already adopting variations of that model. Wipro, for instance, plans to recruit Indian or Japanese managers along with Chinese programmers to expand in China in the coming year. Zensar Technologies, based in Pune, has a new joint venture with Broadengate Systems of China; the venture, Zensar Technologies (Shenzhen), expects to grow from 14 employees to 50 by the end of the year with Indian project managers and Chinese programmers. Cognizant Technology Solutions, based in Teaneck, N.J., but with most of its development operations in India, is taking a different approach. It plans to enter China in 2005 to serve its financial services clients there, and says it will bring Chinese managers to its global development base in Chennai, India, for training. All this activity could translate into a 40 percent slice of the growing China software export pie by 2006 for Indian companies, according to Gartner, the technology research firm based in Stamford, Conn. And while few industry experts say they think that China will rival India as a viable offshore software development center anytime soon, most say they think it will happen eventually. ''The raw materials -- talent and infrastructure -- are there,'' said V. Sriram, the Tokyo-based vice president, Asia Pacific, at Infosys Technologies, ''so it is only a matter of time before the ecosystem evolves.''", "title": "India Taps China's Reserve Of Technological Talent"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/Technology", "Top/News/Business", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/China", "Top/News", "Top/News/World/Asia Pacific", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Technology, Telecommunications and Internet", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Human Resources", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia/China"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Technology; Business", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Business/Financial Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "W", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/business/worldbusiness/02india.html", "print_column": "4", "slug": "02INDI$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "For the first time in 20 years, Japan has redesigned its bank notes, issuing a pretty new series of bills on Monday that feature rabbit-ear irises, the first formal portrait of a woman on a Japanese bank note, and, of course, the requisite image of a snow-capped Mount Fuji, framed in cherry blossoms. Unlike the currency changes once common in South America's inflationary economies, no zeros were lopped off the notes of deflationary Japan. With one United States dollar now worth 106 yen, the new 1,000-yen note is worth $9.45, the new 5,000-yen bill is worth $47.27, and the new 10,000-yen note is worth $94.50. Ostensibly, the newly designed notes that will flood into A.T.M.'s this week were introduced to foil counterfeiters. In 1998, only 800 cases of forged yen notes were detected. But with home computers, printers and copiers becoming increasingly sophisticated, 14,000 fake bills were found in the first half of this year, the National Police Agency said. ''The main reason for issuing new bank notes is the prevention of bank note counterfeits,'' Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, said Monday at the Bank of Japan, the first visit there by a prime minister since 1986. ''This must make counterfeits difficult,'' he said after inspecting the new bills, which have holograms, watermarks and special inks. Counterfeiting probably costs Japan only $1 million a year in direct losses. Most fake bills, generally 1,000-yen notes, are swallowed by vending machines, Japan's ubiquitous mechanical purveyors of drinks and cigarettes. Introducing the new currency will cost hundreds of millions of dollars, partly to issue 10 billion new bank notes, and partly to modify the 1.8 million vending machines in Japan. The high cost suggests another agenda, which appears to be flushing out hidden money. The currency shift is an attempt to bring into the economy trillions of yen that Japan's elderly keep stashed at home. ''The trick in Japan is to unlock the mattress money, the futon money,'' Jesper Koll, chief economist for Merrill Lynch Japan, said. ''In Japan, coins and notes account for about 15 percent of national income, which compares to 6 percent in Germany and 3 to 3.5 percent in America.'' Until Japan's banking crisis hit a decade ago, 7 percent of the national income was held in cash. Now, with the banks increasingly stable, the government hopes to lure some of the $700 billion in mattress money into banks, or better yet into consumer spending and investments. The new 1,000-yen bill features Hideyo Noguchi, a scientist credited with isolating the bacteria that causes syphilis. The 5,000-yen bill has the portrait of Higuchi Ichiyo, a novelist of the late 19th century who wrote of the unhappy, restricted lives of Japanese women. She died of tuberculosis at age 24. The 10,000-yen note continues to use the image of Yukichi Fukuzawa, a 19th-century educator known as the founder of Keio University. Kyodo News said the new bills benefited from ''the world's most advanced printing technologies to prevent counterfeiting.'' But forgers may already be at work. Earlier this month, a stolen test print of the new 1,000-yen bill was briefly put up for auction on an Internet site. Although the old notes are to be withdrawn from circulation two years from now, there is no fixed date for their sunset as legal tender. Even so, Japanese authorities evidently hope that the prime minister's visit to the Bank of Japan will send a signal to people hoarding cash that they should turn in their money. About two-thirds of cash in Japan is held by people over 65 years old. The act of bringing cash to a bank may prompt some to spend it. ''I hope it will help put the economy on a firm recovery path,'' Mr. Koizumi said at the central bank Monday. Standing nearby, Toshihiko Fukui, the central bank governor, told reporters: ''I believe the new bank notes will lift people's spirits and contribute to forming a new, dynamic Japanese economic society.'' On Friday, the Bank of Japan predicted that prices would inch higher in 2005, ending the deflation that began in May 1998. But not all of Japan's cash hoarders are little old ladies who might be tempted to buy kimonos for their granddaughters. About 5 percent of the economy is believed to be operated off the books, either by tax evaders or by members of yakuza, or criminal mobs, to hide ill-gotten gains. ''Because there is so much cash out there in the underground economy, they may not want to trade it in for cash, they may want to buy things,'' Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist for Morgan Stanley Japan, said of the criminal cash hoarders. ''The problem is that there is no particular deadline to turn in your cash.'' Mr. Koll, another skeptic, said: ''You can play around with changing notes. But will the cash actually go into the economy or back into the mattress? That is the million-dollar question.''", "title": "Japan Issues New Currency To Foil Forgers"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/Business", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Japan", "Top/News", "Top/News/World/Asia Pacific", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Banking, Finance and Insurance", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia/Japan"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Business", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Business/Financial Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "W", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/business/worldbusiness/02notes.html", "print_column": "6", "slug": "02NOTE$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Profit at the Toyota Motor Corporation slipped 1.5 percent in the most recent quarter as damage from a falling dollar offset strong increases in sales around the world. Toyota, the world's second-largest carmaker, reported net income of 297.4 billion yen ($2.8 billion) for the quarter ended Sept. 30, as the falling dollar eroded the value of Toyota's sales in the United States. Despite the weaker-than-expected profit, sales growth was faster than had been predicted. Revenue rose 9.3 percent, to 4.52 trillion yen ($42.7 billion), for the quarter, as the company increased vehicle sales at a double-digit pace in nearly every major market. The result comes as Toyota and other Japanese automakers are being increasingly drawn into the fierce discounting battle in the United States. That battle has already taken a severe toll on the profits of Detroit's carmakers. Even with the slippage in earnings, Toyota's report confirmed that it remains one of the fastest-growing and most profitable carmakers in the world. Toyota's profit was still four times the combined earnings of General Motors, the world's largest automaker, and Ford Motor in the period. Toyota also fared better than its closest Japanese rivals. Last week, Honda Motor reported a 7.5 decline in profit and Nissan Motor posted a 3.5 percent fall. Both blamed a weaker dollar and intense price competition in the United States. Toyota, which also makes the Lexus luxury vehicle, expects profit for the full fiscal year ending March 31, 2005, to be near, or greater than, last year's record 1.16 trillion yen ($11 billion), Toyota's managing director, Takeshi Suzuki, told reporters on Monday. Koji Endo, an auto analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston, said Toyota's sales had raced ahead. ''In Japan, the U.S., Europe and Asia, almost everywhere, Toyota's sales volumes have been running ahead of expectations,'' Mr. Endo said. ''There are plenty of reasons to believe that the company will continue to post good earnings. But the company is getting larger and larger, and that means the impact from changes in the macroeconomy is also getting larger and larger.'' Last year, Toyota passed Ford in global sales to become the world's second-largest carmaker. The company is now aiming to expand its global market share to 15 percent by the end of next decade, from about 10 percent now. Toyota is intensifying its assault on foreign markets to achieve that ambitious goal, with new factories going up in China, Europe and the United States. If it hits the target, Toyota could overtake General Motors. On Monday, the company laid out more specific short-term sales targets. The company forecast sales of 7.22 million vehicles globally for the full fiscal year ending next March, which would be an increase of 7.5 percent from 6.72 million last fiscal year. And Toyota's chairman, Hiroshi Okuda, said the company wanted to sell 8.5 million vehicles in 2006. Toyota's sales grew 13 percent, to 1.78 million vehicles, in the recent quarter. In the crucial North American market, where Toyota generates about two-thirds of its profit, the sales grew 12 percent, to 554,000 vehicles, for the quarter, thanks to strong sales of the Camry sedan and Prius gasoline-electric hybrid car. For the first nine months of the year, Toyota claimed a market share of 12.1 percent in the United States, up nearly a full point from 11.2 percent for the period last year. That share puts Toyota close on the heels of DaimlerChrysler, which has 14.3 percent of the market and is No.3 in the United States. The reputation that Toyota enjoys for quality and reliability has helped it expand sales without discounting its vehicles as much as Detroit manufacturers have done. And although its discounts are still not as steep as Detroit's, Toyota has been forced to offer larger incentives this year to keep up. Toyota said that earnings were also slowed by a decline in profit at its truckmaking affiliate, Hino Motors. Toyota holds a 51 percent stake in Hino, Japan's second-largest truckmaker. For the first half of the fiscal year, Toyota said the biggest drag on profits came from a drop in the dollar against the yen, which eats into the value of its overseas earnings when reported in yen. Toyota loses about 20 billion yen of operating profit a year for every yen that the Japanese currency strengthens against the dollar. The yen traded at an average 110 yen to the dollar in the quarter just ended, compared with an average of 118 yen a year earlier. Toyota continued its aggressive expansion in Asian markets during the recent quarter, reporting a 44 percent increase in sales in the region, to 184,000 vehicles. The company got a late start compared with Honda, G.M. and others in China but has been quickly expanding production there in an effort to catch up. In Europe, Toyota reported that its vehicle sales increased 11 percent, to 229,000.", "title": "Weaker Dollar Causes Toyota's Profit to Slip"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/Business", "Top/News", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Activities and Interests/Road Trips"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Business", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Business/Financial Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "W", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/business/worldbusiness/02toyota.html", "print_column": "5", "slug": "02TOYO$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Volkswagen and its workers entered a critical week in their wage negotiations on Monday, with signs that a compromise was taking shape even as protests flared at factories across Germany. Volkswagen is demanding a two-year freeze in wages, in addition to concessions on a variety of work rules, as it tries to cut its labor costs nearly one-third by 2011. The union, IG Metall, originally asked for a 4 percent wage increase, but has trimmed that demand to 2 percent. Now, according to officials at Volkswagen, the gap may be narrowed further with a one-time payment to the workers. Representatives of each side spoke informally before sitting down Monday afternoon for a sixth round of talks in Hanover. ''These are the critical days if we are going to have a deal,'' said a spokesman for Volkswagen, Dirk Grosse-Leege. ''I would expect to see something this week, and sooner rather than later.'' The showdown is being closely watched, and not just because it pits Germany's most powerful union against its most prominent carmaker. The talks are viewed as a litmus test of whether German auto workers can preserve their privileges in the fiercely competitive global car industry. In a sign of how high the stakes are, the union has threatened large-scale strikes against Volkswagen if the talks do not produce an agreement this week. They would be the first in the company's history. The union is already flexing its muscles, with 15,000 workers staging protests at Volkswagen plants in Braunschweig, Kassel and Emden. On Tuesday, it plans to hold a warning strike at Volkswagen's flagship factory in Wolfsburg, which employs more than 50,000 people. While company representatives and union leaders are hinting at a compromise, the warm-up strikes have injected a combustible element into an already tense situation, according to labor experts. ''There are risks for both sides,'' said Michael Fichter, an expert in labor relations at the Free University of Berlin. ''The union is hierarchical. But there are an awful lot of members involved. Once the machinery starts, you can't always anticipate how things are going to turn out.'' The General Motors Corporation recently weathered a bitter six-day strike at one of its Opel plants here, after it announced plans to reduce its European work force by up to 12,000 jobs, most of them in Germany. IG Metall found itself sidelined as its members vented their rage at G.M. Volkswagen has been more oblique about the issue of job losses, saying that if it is not able to reduce its labor costs by $2.6 billion over six years, 30,000 jobs will theoretically be in jeopardy. But it has also offered its workers a guarantee of job security if they agree to its demands. In addition to a wage freeze, Volkswagen wants six other concessions -- including more flexibility in how it pays overtime, reduced health care benefits and a new policy on apprentices that would cost less and would give VW the option of not offering the apprentices permanent jobs. Volkswagen's labor contract is unique in German industry because it covers only the company's 103,000 assembly-line workers. Other contracts cover entire industries, and thus guarantee wage parity among employers. VW's workers are paid 20 percent more than other metal workers. They also work fewer hours. A decade ago, Volkswagen's chief negotiator, Peter Hartz, signed a deal with IG Metall that reduced the workweek to four days. He is leading the talks this time as well. The time provisions of Volkswagen's old contract were so generous, Mr. Fichter said, that some of its line workers trained as electricians or other craftsmen and more than a few of them moonlight in other jobs. ''There are people working there who could go out and start businesses of their own,'' he said. With Volkswagen reporting a 65 percent decline in profits last week, analysts say such generosity is no longer affordable. The company has felt enormous pressure to cut costs as it faces a stagnant home market and competition from the more efficient Japanese manufacturers. Moreover, Volkswagen owns factories in Slovakia and Hungary, where wages are a fraction of those in Germany. As the company decides where to produce new models, like a sports utility vehicle smaller than the existing Touareg, it is using that cost disparity as a bargaining chip. Volkswagen's supervisory board is scheduled to meet on Nov. 12 to discuss some of these production decisions.

But the drama, being given its world premiere by the Abingdon Theater, sidesteps smarminess with sharp performances and unflinching dialogue, delivering a jolt that is usually absent from this increasingly overworked genre. Anne DuPont is refreshingly blunt as Cori Archer, who, as the play opens, is estranged from her aged father, a former preacher. How estranged? When the phone rings with bad news about his health, she tells the caller: ''He's not dead, is he? When he dies, call me.'' Yet she finds herself heading south to Florida from New York to see the old man, nicely played by Jim Ireland. We see glimpses of her childhood, including a pivotal episode in which her father, preaching a fundamentalist-sounding breed of Christianity, held her up as a bad example in front of the entire congregation. ''God's Daughter,'' though, is no feel-good tale of reconciliation. In Florida, Cori clashes with a neighbor (Susanne Marley) who after the death of Cori's mother became her father's housemate and caretaker and perhaps more. And her father's sad condition does not melt Cori's heart the way it would in a more amateurish work. In fact, it seems to focus her hatred. ''I love seeing you like this: pathetic, helpless,'' she tells him as part of a shockingly caustic rant, though in the haze of Alzheimer's he seems unaffected. There is some healing before the play is through, but under Alex Dmitriev's deft direction it is left subtle and ambiguous. ''God's Daughter'' emerges not as the expected story of mended fences, but as one woman's struggle to vanquish personal demons. Through Nov. 21; at the June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street.

The tent is home to the Big Apple Circus, and, in its 27th season, the troupe founded by Paul Binder and Michael Christensen has come up with a winning, eye-filling new production, ''Picturesque.'' Combining an array of admirable circus skills with a salute to the visual arts, this show, directed by Michel Barette, pays tribute, as Mr. Binder put it the other night, ''to artists who have been inspired by the circus.'' So here among others in the costumes by Mirena Rada and the scenic design of Dan Kuchar are Degas' ballerinas, Picasso's harlequins, Magritte's bowler-hatted men, Toulouse-Lautrec and the cancan dancers of Montmartre. And, in the spirit of the entertainment, even Grandma (Barry Lubin), the Big Apple's ever-popular signature clown, may be seen under an artist's beret flourishing a palette and painter's brush. But more than scenery and costumes dazzles the eye. Take, for example, Picaso Jr., the flabbergasting fellow who manages to juggle five Ping-Pong-size balls blown from his mouth. Or the animal trainer Svetlana Shamsheeva, who could teach diplomats a thing or two because she has taught cats and dogs to work in harmony, and cats and birds, too. Doubters can find proof at the Big Apple, where, among other marvels of Ms. Shamsheeva's two appearances, a cat rides the back of a dog and a cat and a bird are partners in a high-wire act. Also demanding to be seen to be believed are the 13-member Kovgar troupe. Not content with the risk of high-flying acrobatics launched from teeterboards, these daredevils do some of their somersaulting stunts on stilts. In the great tradition of Chinese circus, GuiMing Meng takes the juggling of ceramic jars, one bigger and heavier than another, to the loftiest levels of expertise. Along with these highlights come pleasures like the graceful trapeze work of the Mongolian Angels, the supple, balletic strength of the hand balancer Mei Ling and the well-trained Arabian horses of Yasmine Smart. And the list of performers is not complete. Spicing the performance, too, are plenty of clowning and lively music. From any viewpoint, ''Picturesque'' is a joy to behold. Performances by the Big Apple Circus continue through Jan. 9.

That production afforded one of the great nights of my operagoing life. With the company's production of Gyorgy Ligeti's black comedy ''Le Grand Macabre,'' which opened on Friday, Ms. Rosenberg has presented the American premiere of another bracing contemporary opera that has been neglected in the United States, though it has been seen in more than a dozen European cities since its premiere in 1978 in Stockholm. Mr. Ligeti, 81, was said not to be well enough to travel from Europe for the opening night. The boldly modern production from the Royal Danish Opera, directed by Kasper Bech Holten, and the performance of the San Francisco singers and orchestra made a compelling case for this unconventional work. Though there were empty seats about the house, the audience, with notable numbers of festive Bay Area residents arrayed in exotic Halloween costumes, responded with a prolonged ovation. The audience reaction is important to note, because with her passion for contemporary opera Ms. Rosenberg is not just acting on principle. She strongly believes in the theatrical impact and musical richness of works like Mr. Ligeti's opera, and she is right. Mr. Ligeti, born in Budapest, came of age within the culturally restricted confines of a Soviet-bloc country. Paradoxically, his isolation may have benefited him, for when he left Hungary in 1956 and immersed himself in European modernism, he was open to everything and suspicious of dogma. His music embraces all manner of styles and techniques, but in his own ingenious way. For ''Le Grand Macabre,'' his only opera, Mr. Ligeti's source was a play by Michel de Ghelderode, an apocalyptic romp. Mr. Ligeti wrote the libretto with Michael Meschke. Set, as Mr. Ligeti has put it, ''in the run-down but nevertheless carefree and thriving principality of Bruegelland in an 'anytime' century,'' the story is peopled by peasants, exotic creatures and buffoonish government officials. The main characters include Piet the Pot, a professional wine taster who is always tipsy; Amando and Amanda, an oblivious pair of lovers; Astradamors, an eccentric court astronomer who suffers the abuse of his bullying wife; and the ineffectual and infantile Prince Go-Go. The principality is racked with dread when, in the opening scene, Nekrotzar, the sinister ''Grand Macabre'' of the title, arises from a grave to announce that he is death incarnate and has come to destroy the world that very night. The original German libretto was translated into Swedish for the premiere, and Mr. Ligeti has requested that the work always be performed in the language of the audience. (This production uses an English translation by Geoffrey Skelton.) It is essential for the audience to follow the libretto, because the opera includes a lot of talking, though not as much as it originally did. Mr. Ligeti, feeling that there was too much shouting in the opera, cut dialogue and added music, finally settling on the 1996 version presented here. The risk with Mr. Ligeti's chatty approach to opera is that the music will seem like some raucous background score to a bleakly comic drama, a quality emphasized in this production with the cartoon imagery of Steffen Aarfing's sets and the madcap pacing of Mr. Holten's direction. With all the zany surface energy of Mr. Ligeti's score, it would be easy to let the sophistication and richness of the music slip by. The work opens with a mini-overture for 12 honking car horns, all specifically pitched. The overture is a perfect palindrome; played forward or backward, the music sounds the same. As the opera continues, your ear is caught by bursts of modernistic bedlam and wildly scored convolutions in the orchestra, which is dominated by percussion instruments. But ruminative and beguiling episodes keep coming, like the wistfully ethereal love duet for Amando and Amanda and a transfixing and harmonically hazy quintet in Scene 2. The conductor, Michael Boder, drew an incisive, vividly colored and wonderfully brash account of the score from the orchestra. The bass-baritone Willard White, who triumphed in the title role of ''St. Fran\u00e7ois'' two years ago, was equally compelling as the maniacal Nekrotzar. Standouts in the strong cast included the tenor Graham Clark as Piet the Pot, the bass Clive Bayley as the sniveling Astradamors, the countertenor Gerald Thompson as the glutinous and pasty-faced Prince Go-Go, and the mezzo-soprano Sara Fulgoni and the soprano Anne-Sophie Duprels as the insatiable lovers Amando and Amanda. Nekrotzar's plan to destroy fizzles humiliatingly. The opera ends with an intricate passacaglia in which the principals, eventually joined by the chorus, state the work's quizzical ''moral.'' ''Fear not to die,'' the text begins; you don't know when your time will come, so in the face of death, chaos and corruption you might as well make love, embrace the day and live merrily. ''Le Grand Macabre'' will be repeated at the San Francisco Opera on Friday and on Nov. 9, 13, 18 and 21.

For seven years (1996-2003) his band was the Academy of Ancient Music, one of the great British ensembles formed in the 1970's. But last year Mr. Manze moved to the English Concert, which in the 1970's and 80's was the academy's most direct rival, and on Sunday afternoon he led his new band in a program of Mozart, Schmelzer and plenty of Vivaldi at Alice Tully Hall. Mr. Manze's style is flashier and more vigorous than that of his predecessor, Trevor Pinnock, the group's founder. But Mr. Pinnock, a harpsichordist, could hardly hop around as much as a violinist can. Mr. Manze uses that purely physical freedom considerably: there is no mistaking his downbeat, which sometimes involves a twist toward the players behind him and a slight, deft shuffle that would do a rock guitarist proud. The group now also plays standing (except its cellists, bassist and harpsichordist) and wears open-necked shirts in electric blue and purple. Mr. Manze's interpretive style is different as well. To borrow terms from the Supreme Court, Mr. Pinnock was a strict constructionist, intent on delivering the letter of the score directly and clearly, and Mr. Manze is an activist, willing to reshape a work to suit an interpretive goal. His trim, energetic ''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik'' (K. 525) was driven by adventurous tempo manipulations and big dynamic contrasts. Two Vivaldi Violin Concertos -- one in E (RV 271) and one in C minor (RV 202) -- were also aggressively shaped, with bristling, dynamically fluid allegros. Mr. Manze was the soloist, and he was at his best in the singing lines of the slow movements. The program also included a Vivaldi Concerto for Four Violins in B minor (RV 580), for which Mr. Manze was joined by Walter Reiter, Miles Golding and Rodolfo Richter. The real find on this program, though, was an odd gem from the German pre-Bach Baroque, the Serenata Con Altre Arie by Johann Heinrich Schmelzer. It is rich in characterizations, with the second of its five movements a vivid portrait of Harlequin and the last a lament with tolling bells evoked by the strings in repeated tones. The work also showed this ensemble at its tightest and most persuasive. The English Concert appears tomorrow at Symphony Center in Chicago.

Sure, it was understandable that NBC would try to capitalize on the moral backlash against slasher beauty programs -- the kind with bone saws -- to produce a reality contest that rewards participants for losing weight ''the old school way,'' as the comedian Caroline Rhea puts it in her uninspired turn as host. We all know it's righteous to force people to diet strictly and exercise tirelessly. But has no one at the network ever been on a diet? Diets are depressing, boring, repetitive -- and marked by eventless phases during which no weight comes off. You're hungry and tired and nothing changes. Somebody thought this would be exciting to watch? After only two weeks of ''The Biggest Loser,'' viewers may already miss the likes of Dr. Jon Perlman of ''Extreme Makeover,'' with his unnatural eyelids, trim figure, humming saw and spectacular results. If only all weight could be water weight. That's what the producers of the new show must have thought after last week's episode. Water weight, whatever that is, is known for being dramatic; it comes off fast. On the first episode of ''The Biggest Loser,'' it came off in great ooh-and-ah-inspiring gobs -- like 22 pounds in seven days, which is what Matt lost -- that really lit up the gargantuan scale in the episode's big reveal. (The show divides heavyweights into two teams: after working out and dieting for a week, the teams weigh in, and the one that has lost the least weight collectively is required to vote off a teammate.) The big numbers, combined with the novelty of seeing advanced cases of gynecomastia flaunted on national television, were remarkable. Also interesting were the evident difficulty and sincerity of the effort -- a graphic reminder that body weight is less tractable than dieters must perforce believe. But then plateaus were hit. Back up on the Stairmaster, out for their early jogs, home to the skimpy meals, pushups, crunches, weights, more cardio, nothing to eat. It looked sickening. The dieters appeared to work harder that week than they had in the first one. And yet, when it was time to board the giant scale -- which, with its oversized L.E.D. display, suitable for Times Square, is the stuff of nightmares -- the numbers just weren't there. People lost seven or three pounds, and they were the big victors. Dave, at 240 pounds, lost nothing; neither did Maurice at 423. Matt even gained three pounds, which made the assembly cry. Each team has its own coach, and these coaches are meant to represent schools of thought. Jillian is the Puritan figure: unforgiving, unrelenting, contemptuous of gluttony and laziness. She coaches the red team, and feeds them fiber and protein in miniature portions. Bob, the blue-team coach, is maternal. He has an appealing notion that people must eat more to lose weight. This might be a suggestive split, if ''The Biggest Loser'' can find a way to use it to enliven the flatlining weight-loss narrative, shifting the show's focus from the capricious numbers to what is most reliable on reality television: the squabbles and the proto-romances. To a one, the contestants are good-looking; they have evidently been chosen so that, less 50 pounds or so, they will be knockouts. Several, predictably, are described in their online bios as funny and charismatic. (Come on, just say it: they're jolly.) But with the especially attractive Dana and Lizzeth eliminated -- their teams determined that they were already too slim, at 170 and 164 respectively, to contribute much to the final tally of pounds lost -- team members ought to check out who's left. They should form some alliances and make some passes. The show needs divided loyalties. Contestants should be torn between, say, who should be eliminated for the good of the team and who should be eliminated because they are romantic competition. But maybe drama is not what this series, which skips tonight because of the presidential elections, is about. Maybe it is genuinely about diet and exercise -- the slow, tortuous way to self-knowledge, if not slimness. That's a principled approach, but viewers will not stick with it. As in dieting, so in diet television. After a week or two, it's just too easy to abandon fiber and daylong workouts in favor of something that looks more fun. Like suction lipectomy. Like abdominoplasty. CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK", "title": "Isn't It How You Play The Game?

Any passions left uninflamed might be stirred by the book's subtitle: ''The Hidden Toll of Day Care, Behavioral Drugs and Other Parent Substitutes.'' That seems to label it as another book bashing working mothers, blaming them for the ills of society and condemning them for putting their happiness above that of their children. Not so, says Mary Eberstadt, the author of ''Home-Alone America,'' being published this week by Sentinel, an imprint of Penguin Group USA that focuses on conservative viewpoints. ''This isn't a finger-pointing book,'' she said in an interview. ''It's not a blaming book. It's an attempt to deliver what I know to be an out-of-the-box examination of a serious social question. That question is, why do kids today have serious problems that their parents' generation and their grandparents' generation did not?'' Authors on both the left and the right have produced scores of books in recent years that either laud motherhood as the greatest profession or insist that mothers are able to provide substantive role models for their children only by working outside the home. What Mrs. Eberstadt says makes ''Home-Alone America'' different is that it looks not at mothers or fathers or work or other grown-up concerns; rather, she says, it looks at what is happening to children: obesity, high rates of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease, and the rapidly growing use of psychiatric medications even among very young children. ''I'm trying to move the spotlight,'' she said. ''I'm making an honest effort to get the adults off the stage.'' She also stresses that she does not want to cast blame for those problems on working mothers. ''Half the book,'' she said, ''is about what happens when you take Dad out of the house, whether through unwed motherhood or divorce.'' Whether her approach and arguments are truly different or are a more strident version of previous books on parenthood and children is an open question. What is certain is that Sentinel, the publisher, is hoping that ''Home-Alone America'' draws the kind of attention that often accompanies books published by Regnery, the king of conservative publishers. Certainly many experts on parenthood -- not to mention many mothers -- could dispute that a mother's working outside the home is any way comparable to a father's abandonment of the family. ''There's no perfect answer to any of these problems,'' said Dr. Leon Hoffman, director of the Parent-Child Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Society. It is all but impossible to generalize about the causes of behavioral problems and conditions like obesity, Dr. Hoffman said, because of all the variables at play with child, parent and environment. ''Home-Alone America'' certainly presents a stark picture of American youth. Citing sources as varied as ''The Maury Povich Show'' and the Journal of the American Medical Association, Mrs. Eberstadt documents rapidly rising rates of obesity among children (although she focuses more on those rates than on the actual percentage of children who are seriously overweight). She presents disturbing statistics about the growth in the use of psychiatric drugs to treat attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity. And she includes familiar but still troubling figures on teen pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Mrs. Eberstadt's book attempts to link these problems to absent parents. Obesity, she writes, is in large part the product of a lack of supervision when children return every afternoon to empty homes or are mollified by sugary snacks in day care or at after-school programs. So many children are medicated, she says, because parents spend less time with them, and therefore do not know how children really behave. And while they are unsupervised, teenagers, not surprisingly, are sometimes having sex. ''Over the past few decades, more and more children have spent considerably less time in the company of their parents or other relatives, and numerous fundamental measures of their well-being have simultaneously gone into what once would have been judged scandalous decline,'' Mrs. Eberstadt writes. ''It is the argument of this book that the connection between those facts cannot possibly be dismissed as coincidence.'' Other authors who have studied parenting and its effects raise questions about whether the connection that Mrs. Eberstadt makes between these problems and absent parents is quite so clear. Take obesity, for example. ''A lot of devoted, around-the-clock parents take their kids regularly to McDonald's,'' said Ann Crittenden, the author of ''The Price of Motherhood: Why the Most Important Job in the World Is Still the Least Valued.'' If such a link were so clear, she argues, obesity rates should be much lower in families with stay-at-home mothers. And while Ms. Crittenden agreed that the use of psychiatric drugs is too frequent among adolescents and children, she said she has seen little evidence to connect that usage to working parents. Mrs. Eberstadt, a Washington-based research fellow for Stanford's Hoover Institution, says she recognizes that many mothers have to work out of economic necessity. ''But this is a book for people who have choices,'' she said. ''Any one family might be fine participating in the trends mentioned in the book. But if you step back from that individual family and look at society as a whole, I think you see that some people aren't fine. Some kids in day care do just great. Some kids in day care have problems because of day care. I think we can open an honest conversation about these things.'' A child of divorced parents, Mrs. Eberstadt expressed surprise when it was suggested that readers are likely to wonder about how her own children fare when she is working. She addresses that subject in her book's introduction. ''Three of my children are in school all day long and the youngest is on the verge of it,'' she writes. ''I have a part-time paid babysitter who is upstairs while I'm down,'' where she maintains her home-office, ''a husband who often works at home, and older children who also help with the youngest one.'' Again, she added, the book is as much about the effects of divorce as about working mothers. ''Some families divorce and the kids turn out fine,'' she said. ''Some families divorce and the kids are miserable and develop serious problems. I'm not generalizing about any individual situation or any particular family. I'm saying step back and look at the scene as a whole.'' To emphasize that fathers are as much the culprits in these trends as mothers, she notes that the back cover of the book features another photo, this one of a father leaving for work, with a child clinging to his ankle. ''Maybe for the paperback we can flip the pictures around if that would make people happier,'' she said. But Mrs. Eberstadt does not apologize, either for the assertions in her book or for the cover photographs. ''What this does is grasp the key feature of the book, which is to focus on that child's phenomenological experience,'' she said of the pictures. ''The eminence of what is happening to him at that particular moment, that is the focus that has been missing from this debate. That's why I dwell on the immediate emotional experience of some kids in day care. ''In every chapter of the book,'' she added, ''I'm trying to get at the immediate experience of these problems and what they mean for today's kids.''", "title": "New Salvo Is Fired In Mommy Wars"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/Features/Arts", "Top/Features/Books", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Activities and Interests/Family", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology and Science", "Top/News/Health", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Media, Entertainment and Publishing"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Arts; Health; Books", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "E", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/books/02home.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "02HOME$02"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Ximude, the director of the Jerim League Museum in Tongliao, a city in Inner Mongolia, was perplexed by the American visitor's strange interests. Why was he mesmerized by tiny objects that Ximude didn't find all that significant -- a three-inch-long gold pendant in the shape of a crouching horse, or the miniature plaque, 21/2 by 4 inches, showing a female figure flanked by two animals? ''After we look at these, I'll take you hunting,'' he told the American. ''That's much more fun.'' But his visitor, James C.Y. Watt, a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, had no time to play. He was on another kind of hunting expedition, scavenging vast areas of China for remnants of the historical period that would eventually be illuminated in ''China: Dawn of a Golden Age, 200-750 A.D.,'' which opened last month at the Met. Behind this prodigious exhibition is a story of curatorial obsession and adventure, as well as a glimpse at how China's internal bureaucracy has subtly opened up recently, at least vis-\u00e0-vis the art world. American specialists found their Chinese museum counterparts accessible in a way that would have been unheard of just a few years earlier. On that monthlong trip, taken in 1998, Mr. Watt -- who would become chairman of the museum's Asian art department in 2000 -- traveled alone to 15 cities by train, car and airplane. Well, alone except for the five or six days he spent with Chen Kun, director of the Guyuan Museum, who on a whim drove Mr. Watt hundreds of miles in his Chinese-brand Volkswagen car at breakneck speed to tiny museums in obscure cities. Mr. Chen's chief curator went along for the ride, talking shop with Mr. Watt in the back seat or over lamb served up in a roadside tent in the autonomous region of Ningxia, populated mainly by Muslims. Slender and bookish, Mr. Watt, 68, doesn't automatically bring to mind Indiana Jones, especially when he's sitting in a three-piece suit in his orderly office at the Met, speaking rapturously about the Roman influence evident in a gilt bronze cup decorated with figures and a grapevine. But his trek to remotest China was crucial to his ambitious quest: to use archaeological artifacts to illustrate how China, during the Tang dynasty in the seventh and eighth centuries, absorbed influences from all over the world, synthesized them and created a new multiethnic Chinese culture. While many of the objects are small, the scope of the exhibition was always grand, in both its concept and its logistics. Surprisingly, it was inspired not by scholarly meditation on ancient China, but by a newcomer's impression of New York, circa mid-1980's. From the time Mr. Watt moved to the city 19 years ago, he was struck by how his new home seemed to be a microcosm of international living that for him echoed a different time, a different place. ''I realized that New York is like eighth-century China,'' he said. ''Nobody is a stranger, just as nobody was a stranger in the capital of China in the Tang dynasty.'' The thought of an exhibition did not occur until much later, when Philippe de Montebello, the museum's director, approached him and Wen C. Fong, then chairman of the Asian art department, in 1997 about doing a China show. The Metropolitan had put on \"Splendors of Imperial China\" the year before, but that blockbuster consisted of objects borrowed from Taiwan. The museum hadn't had a Chinese China exhibition since 1980, but other museums were staking out the territory. Mr. de Montebello couldn't help but notice that a few blocks away the Solomon R. Guggenheim was putting together a huge show for 1998, ''China: 5000 Years.'' ''I said, 'Do you want a big one or a modest one?''' Mr. Watt recalls asking. Mr. de Montebello replied, ''Big one!'' A few months later Mr. Watt set out on that initial scouting trip, armed with notebooks, a camera and a suitcase full of gifts, mainly ties decorated with images of the Statue of Liberty. He returned with three thick albums filled with photographs of some 1,000 objects and dozens of ties he received as gifts from his Chinese hosts (''mostly unwearable,'' he said). That was only the beginning. After his trip, Mr. Watt returned to his books, seeking the historical trail that would connect the archaeological markers. He read for two years. He enlisted a team of longtime colleagues from Russia, New York and China who were experts in metalwork, numismatics, glass, textiles and Buddhist art. It would take several visits by each of them, together and separately, scouting storage rooms and exhibition halls, to finally settle on the 247 works -- 350 if you count multiple parts -- now on display. In all, 46 lending institutions were involved, including the Palace Museum in Beijing as well as archaeological institutions in the boondocks of China. Mr. Watt was not averse to including larger-than-life objects: the show's grand finale is a carving of a giant Buddha, nearly eight feet tall. But he was preoccupied with items that would indicate how other cultures -- Central Asian, Roman, Persian, Hellenistic, nomadic -- had infiltrated the everyday fixations of the Chinese (mainly the upper classes) through custom and style: how they decorated themselves, their tombs and their homes; what they drank out of; what they wore; the stories they told; how they prayed. Evidence of such influences might crop up in the fold of a drape, a statue's facial features, a textile design. Above all, he was looking for the melting-pot ingredients that made it possible, during the Tang dynasty, for a Turk to achieve the top position in China's civil and military service, and for intermarriage between nomadic peoples and Chinese. This ancient story was, for him, rooted in the present in more ways than one. Major construction in China over the past 30 years has turned the country into one big archaeological site. More than 100 of the works in the show were unearthed in this period. ''It is almost impossible to dig anywhere in China without finding something; even if you have a little plot of land behind your house, you can't do gardening without this stuff spilling out,'' Mr. Watt said. He regularly monitored new discoveries by reading archaeological journals from China, including some posted on the Internet. (An assistant downloads them; Mr. Watt doesn't know how to turn his Met computer on.) It was by reading these archaeological abstracts that he discovered, for example, the tiny objects from the second, third and fourth centuries that so fascinated him at the little Jerim League Museum in Inner Mongolia. While those pieces were unearthed in 1984 and 1990, other, even newer archaeological finds gave the show a sense of immediacy. Eight pieces excavated since 2000 were added to the exhibition at the last minute. Some of the show's finest objects turned up in the strangest places. Angela F. Howard, a professor at Rutgers University and Mr. Watt's consultant in Chinese Buddhist art, made three trips for the exhibition, always traveling within China with a longtime colleague, Li Chongfeng, chairman of the archaeology department at Beijing University. To look at a stunning sarcophagus from the sixth century that was excavated in 1999, she had to visit the local police station in Taiyuan, in Shanxi Province. ''It had been placed there for fear it would be stolen and taken out of the country,'' she said. In Sichuan Province, she had to contend with monks who didn't want their exquisite standing bodhisattvas to leave the temple where they were on display. (Beijing officials intervened on the museum's behalf, and the statues made it to New York.) Mr. Watt, born and brought up in Hong Kong, has visited China frequently over the years. ''Before, it was impossible to travel so quickly because of the bureaucracy,'' he said. ''It was very tense and not so easy to have access even among colleagues. You had to go through these different steps first.'' ''Now,'' he said, ''you just go.'' Still, he added, he did have to stop in Beijing first to check in with the State Administration of Cultural Heritage. ''Not so much for clearance as notification,'' he said, though government approval is still required for all foreign loans. The Guggenheim Museum's big China exhibition in 1998 required considerable behind-the-scenes machinations, including the intervention of Henry A. Kissinger (who is also trustee emeritus of the Metropolitan Museum). Mr. Watt suggested that the Met's grass-roots approach made a difference. ''A lot of people do go around China with an entourage,'' he said. ''I went by myself. We were talking to our own colleagues. We never, from beginning to end, we never touched any branch of the political structure.'' Yet Mr. Watt acknowledged that he and his team had also benefited from changes within China that accelerated at the end of the 1990's and have since become more apparent. ''There's much greater awareness of the need to be open to the outside world generally, and much greater relaxation within China, and much greater willingness to listen to professional as opposed to ideological reasons,'' he said. That view is echoed by Kimerly Rorschach, director of the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University. Until recently, Ms. Rorschach was director at the Smart Museum of the University of Chicago, which this summer organized an exhibition of works by contemporary Chinese artists with the International Center of Photography in Manhattan. When she assembled a 1999 exhibition of contemporary Chinese art at the Smart Museum, she said, ''It was almost impossible to go through government channels.'' ''It was hard to bring works out and also very difficult to return them,'' she said. ''I would say that since 1999, that's pretty much gone away. The suspicion and the difficulties, all that has really evaporated.'' That despite the Beijing government's secretive attitude toward its political deliberations and its tendency to chafe at or retaliate for open criticism in the news media. It helped that the Met show did not focus on paintings and frescoes, objects that the Chinese can be particularly sticky about -- mainly for reasons of preservation rather than politics, Mr. Watt said. At least one case required personal intervention by Mr. de Montebello with the State Administration of Cultural Heritage. The Chinese government has a general policy against lending paintings predating the 12th century because of their fragility. But Mr. Watt really wanted a painted lacquer screen from the fifth century depicting virtuous women and obedient sons, whose subject and style reflected how one region's artists influenced another's. Mr. de Montebello convinced the state agency that these were not paintings, really, but archaeological finds and therefore exempt. For Mr. Watt, such glitches were a small part of a knotty task that he found remarkably painless, considering that it required the collaboration of so many specialists and institutions in far-flung places.

Sometimes that can be a problem. On one late-night flight to Hong Kong, I slept through a six-hour takeoff delay. When we landed in Vancouver for a stopover, I had no idea why it was daylight when it should have been dark. Another time, on a flight from Jakarta to Bangkok, I fell asleep on takeoff and didn't hear the pilot announce that the plane had to return to the airport because of engine trouble. I woke up three hours later and was mystified as to why we were still in Jakarta. Public transportation of any kind can be a challenge. Several years ago, I had an important presentation to give in Bangkok. The morning of the meeting, the car and driver I had reserved weren't there, so I jumped into a taxi, gave the driver the address and became engrossed in my papers. When the driver stopped the car, I looked up and saw nothing but rice paddies. The driver didn't understand English, so I used hand signals to make him turn around and speed back into the city. I had him drop me off at the first hotel we came to, got another cab and arrived at the meeting 45 minutes late. About six years ago, working late in my hotel room in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, I used my portable bubble jet printer to write letters to 50 individuals on our company letterhead to confirm meetings in Jakarta the following week. At 1 a.m., I asked the front desk to fax them separately to the number listed on each page. When the faxes were returned to my room less than an hour later, I looked at the single confirmation sheet and realized that all 50 had been sent to the executive whose name appeared on the first one. I was so mad that I had the front desk employee call the hotel's general manager at home and wake him up in the middle of the night. He apologized profusely, and in turn, I apologized to the man who received the 50 faxes. He was not amused that my ''personalized'' request for a meeting with him was identical to the other 49, except for his name. I've also had my share of fashion faux pas because of my crazy travel schedule. Once the hotel cleaners mixed up two suits and put the jacket from the first suit on a hanger with the pants from the second suit. I got dressed quickly that morning and didn't notice and wore a dark green suit jacket and black pants to that client meeting. I should be used to surprises by now, but there was that memorable meal in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. It was a hot day, and a client took me to an outdoor restaurant. I was dripping from the heat -- and from the hot, spicy food -- and trying to look normal. Then the waiter served us yet another dish. I realized after a few minutes that the bowl was an upside-down turtle shell. It took me another few minutes to realize I was eating turtle. But at least I got fed at that meal. One client took me to a restaurant in Shenzhen, China, that served only snake. I said I was still full from lunch.

Gaynier, a New York lawyer, is hopping mad because, she says, getting on an airplane these days means being groped by a stranger. According to her and others, groping of airline passengers has increased since the Transportation Security Administration issued new guidelines recently requiring checkpoint screeners to conduct more frequent, and more intimate, pat-downs. Reactions have been strong, especially from women. ''Listen, I don't particularly like it when my doctor gives me a breast exam, O.K.?'' said Ms. Gaynier, who is 46. ''And now I'm supposed to accept a breast exam, in public, at the airport? Next time I'll drive rather than flying.'' The new T.S.A. policy went into effect Sept. 22. The policy states, in part, ''Additional screening, including pat-down searches, may be required of passengers based on visual observations by screeners, even if the audible alarm has not gone off.'' Another provision states, ''T.S.A. policy is that screeners are to use the back of the hand when screening sensitive body areas, which include the breasts (females only), genitals and buttocks.'' Ms. Gaynier, one of dozens of female passengers nationally who have been taking their objections about the new policy to the news media, said that she had not been selected for a secondary screening for years, until Oct. 19. Then, at Tampa International Airport while en route home to New York on a standard round-trip ticket purchased on American Airlines, she was directed to stand aside -- rudely, she said -- for a random secondary screening. Next, ''I had to step over to an area where they have a mat on the floor with footprints on it,'' she said. ''The screener does more of the wand thing, but then she starts patting me down. She puts a hand under my armpit and then up over my shoulder.'' ''What are you doing?'' Ms. Gaynier asked. ''Well, ma'am, this is our new screening procedure,'' came the reply. ''Since when? You did the wand thing, you went through my bag and didn't find anything. Why are you touching me like this?'' She said this got the attention of a supervisor, who told her: ''You have to do the screening or you can't get on your flight.'' Ms. Gaynier dug in and argued. ''You're treating me like a common criminal,'' she recalls telling the supervisor. ''You have no probable cause to be searching me like this. This is how a criminal gets treated.'' She says she then handed him her business card. As a lawyer, Ms. Gaynier specializes in real estate and landlord-tenant litigation, not criminal law. ''But I thought, well, I'll throw these legal terms out and see if I can back him down,'' she said. She could not. According to Ms. Gaynier, the supervisor said, ''Well, ma'am, since you're some legal eagle, did you know that you consented to this screening procedure when you purchased your ticket? And that if you don't consent to the screening, you don't get on your plane?'' She relented. ''I said, 'I just want to go home. Do your stupid pat-down and let me out of here.''' But then, she said, she got the pat-down deluxe. ''The agent comes over and starts on my left side. Under my arm, over my shoulder, down the side of my body to my waist, around my waistline, and then she comes up to my bra strap in the back and goes across to my right side, under the armpit, over the shoulders, and then she comes around front and touches me right between my breasts, and then follows the edge of my bra cups around both breasts. ''I was like, 'Whoa! What are you doing?' and I backed up. The supervisor was right there and he says, 'You're not allowing the screening to happen.' And I said, 'You're kidding me. You can't be touching me between my breasts.''' The supervisor summoned the police. Four officers promptly arrived on the scene. ''Real cops -- guns, clubs, the whole nine yards, all for me, this big security threat,'' Ms. Gaynier said. She does concede, ''I pitched quite a fit'' at the intervention. To make a long story short, she did not make her flight. The police escorted her from the gate area. She said she managed to find another flight home, on JetBlue, where she submitted unhappily but without overt objection to another public ''breast exam.'' The T.S.A. says that physical pat-downs are necessary to guard against the sort of nonmetallic explosives that checkpoint metal detectors do not pick up, and that screeners make every effort to protect passengers' privacy. Also, at several airports the T.S.A. is testing new detector technology that does not require a physical pat-down to test for explosives. But for the immediate future, the pat-down is evidently a fact of life for anyone chosen by screeners for a secondary inspection. Screeners are not thrilled with the new rules, either, said Mark Arsenault, a former law enforcement professional who publishes TSA-Screeners.com, an unofficial Web site for screeners to share news and complaints. A recent article on the site was headlined ''Don't Touch My Breasts!'' ''Most of the screeners who have commented to me about the subject seem to empathize with the travelers who complain, but at the same time know that the searches must be done for security reasons -- not to mention the fact that failing to conduct such a search could be grounds for termination under T.S.A. rules,'' said Mr. Arsenault, a graphic designer whose wife is a screener in Sacramento. We'll talk to screeners about this in a future column. Meanwhile, I'd like to hear from travelers with opinions about the issues raised by Ms. Gaynier. On the Road appears each Tuesday.

The baggage handlers who were charged in the thefts were employees of Swissport USA, which transports luggage and cargo from terminals to aircraft. Some of the stolen goods were sold to undercover detectives or on eBay, the online auction house. Since April, about two dozen employees of the Transportation Security Administration have been arrested on charges of stealing from checked bags at six airports. A STEP UP FOR SMALL JETS -- Most business travelers dislike the cramped seating, low ceilings and meager storage space on the 50-seat or smaller regional jets that major airlines deploy on short-haul routes. But lately, airlines have been ordering new models of narrow-body jets in the 70-to-100-seat range that offer more room, more seats and storage, and greater fuel efficiency than regional jets. Recently, for example, United Express, the United Airlines subsidiary, has started using new 70-seat Embraer 170's on its Washington-Dulles service to Houston and Indianapolis, and between Chicago and Indianapolis on flights operated for United Express by Chautauqua Airlines. WHERE AM I NOW, AGAIN? -- The thick pocket-size monthly American Express Executive Travel SkyGuide, which lists global airline schedules in exhaustive detail, is now available electronically in a service called eSkyGuide. The annual subscription is $19.99 for those who already subscribe to the print edition, which costs $79 a year and has more than 90,000 subscribers, said Janet Libert, the editor and publisher. Nonsubscribers can get the new electronic service -- for use on laptop computers, personal digital assistants and other personal electronic devices -- for $69.95 a year. \"Our subscribers are the real road warriors,\" Ms. Libert said. \"For example, they average 185 nights a year in hotels.\" CHINA, HERE WE COME -- Domestic airlines are rushing to add or enhance nonstop service to China as demand grows sharply. On Sunday, United Airlines began daily nonstop service between O'Hare in Chicago and Pudong International Airport in Shanghai. ''United is the only U.S. airline to provide nonstop passenger service between the United States and mainland China,'' said Graham Atkinson, senior vice president for worldwide sales and alliances. United also flies nonstop between Shanghai and San Francisco, and serves Beijing daily from those cities. American Airlines said it was seeking regulatory approval to begin daily nonstop service between Chicago and Shanghai next May. Delta Air Lines said it filed for approval to begin daily nonstop service between Atlanta and Beijing in March 2006. And Continental filed for approval of daily nonstop service between its Newark hub and Beijing and Shanghai. Northwest Airlines serves China through its hub in Tokyo. J.F.K. LEADS THE WAY -- With an 8 percent spurt in traffic, Kennedy Airport in New York led the nation's top 25 airports in the rate of passenger traffic growth last year, a new study by the F.A.A. says. The reasons included more flights by JetBlue Airways, based at Kennedy, and continuing growth in international traffic. Kennedy handled 31.7 million passengers last year, ranking it 17th on the list of the top 25 busiest airports. The two busiest world airports were Atlanta Hartsfield (76.1 million passengers) and Chicago O'Hare (69.3 million). CHEAPEST FARE GUARANTEE -- If you buy an airline ticket on Orbitz.com, the online booking site, and later the same day you find a published fare on Orbitz on the same airline and with the same itinerary for at least $5 less, Orbitz says it will give you a $50 coupon for future airline, hotel and other travel bookings.

Just ask Harold Smith, who works for a specialty surgical-equipment distributor in Fort Worth. One recent morning, as he checked in for a flight to Austin, Tex., an electronic kiosk rejected his seat assignment request and referred him to the ticket counter. An airline employee quietly told him he was ''watch-listed'' and could only board after law enforcement authorities were called. ''I have no idea how my name got on that list,'' said Mr. Smith, who describes himself as an average-looking grandfather with a clean record. He was allowed to check in after a brief wait. Having your name taken off the security administration's watch list, however, is not so easy. For three weeks, after being stopped every time he tried to board a flight, Mr. Smith said he begged airline workers and administration agents for help clearing his name. ''The T.S.A. agents I spoke with didn't know what to do, and they couldn't tell me who the ranking officer was,'' he recalled. Finally, a sympathetic airline worker offered him a phone number for the administration's ombudsman, its passenger advocate. The watch list is a generic term for at least nine government databases estimated to include more than 40,000 names. The names are divided into a no-fly list of a few thousand people suspected of terrorist activity or believed to be a threat to national security and a much larger list of ''selectees'' who are required to be questioned by the security administration before boarding. Despite its size, that second database remains something of a mystery. According to people with access to it, air travelers can be put into it for activities like paying for a ticket with cash, booking a seat at the last minute, flying one way instead of round trip and even arriving at the airport without luggage. There is no way to find out if you are on the list until you check in for a flight. Worse, there may be no way off. Passengers can fill out a disparity claim with the ombudsman's office, which acts as an intermediary between passengers like Mr. Smith and the security agency. ''If it's determined that you're not the individual that is wanted for further questioning, then the airlines will receive notification informing them that the specific individual is not to be detained,'' a T.S.A. spokeswoman, Lauren Stover, said. But that does not mean they are off the watch list. The agency's Office of Intelligence, which currently maintains the watch list, reports that in September, 680 people filed so-called disparity claims indicating that their names had been mistaken for individuals wanted by the government for questioning. Of those, the government had cleared 250 people by October. All that apparently means, however, is that their identities had been clarified to prevent ''false positives;'' the names are not necessarily removed from the databases. In some cases, the agency does delete a person from the list after a waiting period, but it will not say how long it takes or what the criteria are. Nor will it disclose the success rate of passengers whose names are added to the lists for legitimate reasons or their chances of having their names cleared. Mr. Smith is still waiting to find out his exact status. More than a month after he was tagged, the security administration e-mailed him a Passenger Identity Verification Form requesting copies of his driver's license number and voter registration card or military discharge papers, as well as his height, weight and eye color. He filled out the form and returned it within a day, but has not heard from the agency since. Then again, he is no longer being stopped at the airport, and says he expects to be notified soon that he has been cleared. What if the government decides that a traveler has not been misidentified and belongs on its watch list? According to the agency, there is no formal appeals process. Travelers can either accept the decision or, as a last resort, sue the government. That is exactly what several travelers did in April, when they filed a class-action challenge to the watch list with the assistance of the American Civil Liberties Union. The A.C.L.U.'s lead lawyer in the case, Reginald Shuford, said airline passengers were being subjected to repeated delays or detentions and had ''no way to clear their names.'' Mr. Shuford said the watch list violated passengers' constitutional rights. ''There's no mechanism in place that would allow travelers to avoid the repeated humiliation of being singled out as a suspect when they try to fly,'' he said. ''The watch list is a complete mess. Its purpose may be laudable, but the way it's currently administered and maintained does not achieve its purpose.'' Critics of the current screening system agree that the watch list is defective and that frequent travelers are suffering because of it. ''The list is obsolete,'' said Richard Eastman, a technology consultant in Newport Beach, Calif. ''There are more efficient ways of finding a threat.'' He suggested that a smarter way to catch suspicious passengers would be to identify them before check-in, which was the idea behind Capps II, a proposal to prescreen airline passengers that has been abandoned, and its successor, a modified concept called Secure Flight. Under the new program, the responsibility for checking airline passengers' names against the watch lists will shift from the airlines to the security agency, which the agency says will eliminate most of the false alerts caused by what it calls the ''current outdated system.'' Detractors also maintain that the secrecy shrouding the watch list is pointless. ''How do you get on the list?'' asked Edward Hasbrouck, a privacy advocate in San Francisco. ''Nobody knows. How do you get off the list? Nobody knows.'' Ms. Stover of the security administration said passengers were added to the secondary list if there was ''a pattern in something they have done in the past that merits future scrutiny,'' and were put on the no-fly list only if they were wanted ''for activities that may be terrorist-related or pose a threat to national security.'' She declined to elaborate. But Mr. Hasbrouck said even if the government could successfully argue for keeping its reasons secret -- and he doubted it could -- there were still no legal safeguards to prevent innocent passengers from being erroneously added to the watch list. ''The model is flawed,'' he said. ''People should only be placed on the list based on an order from a court of competent jurisdiction following an adversarial evidentiary hearing. The burden of proof should be on the government to show that someone is dangerous, not the other way around.'' He is hardly the only one frustrated by the lists. Frequent travelers like Heather Marie Owens, a corporate travel agent in Norfolk, Va., are so fatigued by their watch-list problems that they have resorted to extraordinary measures. ''On every recent flight I have flown on since November 2001, they tell me I'm on a watch list,'' she said. ''When I ask why, they say it's random. But I don't believe them anymore.'' Ms. Owens said she had endured increasingly humiliating searches by security screeners and had experienced a range of emotions from bewilderment and helplessness to, finally, resignation. On her next trip to Miami, she is bypassing the security agency altogether. ''This time,'' she said, ''I'm driving.''

She has been there since Sept. 30, when the gang members arrived. ''I was inside my house with my two kids when the men came with guns,'' she said. ''They told me to put my hands up. They took my husband and made him to lie on the ground and they started chopping him with machetes. They killed him, then they threw gas on the house and burned it.'' She takes a moment from washing her year-old baby and offers up one of her few possessions, a glossy 4 by 6 photo of her husband, Dominique Avril, a handsome, lanky man smiling into a studio camera. Cit\u00e9-Soleil, the poorest slum in the poorest country in the hemisphere, is split in two by a gang war. Ms. Max Civil and her husband had the misfortune to live near the dividing line between two sections of gang turf -- their neighborhood, Boston, and another, Route 9. A gang leader known as Labani\u00e8re controls Boston. Dread Wilm\u00e9's gang holds sway over Route 9. The gangs had been united behind the former president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whose Lavalas Party returned the favor with guns and money, critics and some gang members say. But Mr. Aristide was driven from office in February, and with his departure, the loyalties of the heavily armed gangs are fraying. In recent weeks, they have viciously turned on one another, catching tens of thousands of ordinary citizens, like Mr. Avril, in the cross-fire. The death toll is impossible to know, but many residents describe dozens of bodies in the streets. Everyone seems to know someone who has been killed recently. The police, who do not enter Cit\u00e9-Soleil, have no figures. ''When Aristide was here, all of Cit\u00e9-Soleil was Lavalas,'' explained Claude G\u00e9rard, 22, a leader in the Boston gang. He wears a yellow mesh tank top and a silver chain. ''Now we're just fighting for our neighborhood. When Aristide was here, he gave a little money to our group, a little to the other side; everyone was O.K.'' The Boston gang is no longer allied with Lavalas, and rumor has it that its members are being paid by other political factions. ''The gangs are mercenary,'' said a police spokeswoman, Dr. Marie Gessy Coicou. ''They work for whoever pays them.'' Now the schools and hospital are closed, nearly all aid organizations have pulled out, and a United Nations peacekeeping force, still not at full strength, is not up to the task. The police station sits empty as well. Cit\u00e9-Soleil has effectively been ceded to the gangs. No one crosses from one side of Cit\u00e9-Soleil to the other -- from Boston to Route 9. But if you choose to do so, you walk into no man's land, where the Avrils lived, block after block of empty homes, many of them burned. This past summer, the streets were thronged with pushcarts, the park was full of children, the market jammed with women selling produce. All are deserted now. Crossing into the Route 9 area, three young men appear on a broken-down moped so bristling with guns it looks like a two-wheeled armored personnel carrier, replete with an AK-47, a Glock 9 millimeter and a .38 Special. Though the two visitors were identified as journalists, the men came running at them, pointing their guns at the visitors' heads and screaming, ''Why are you coming from Boston? What were you doing there? Are you spying on us?'' One, with a Glock, mirrored sunglasses and a Los Angeles Lakers jersey, bounced off the ground like a pogo stick while keeping his gun trained on the visitors. The interpreter begged them not to shoot until he had a chance to show them something. He produced from his wallet a picture of Mr. Aristide, one that he keeps for such an occasion. The men were somewhat placated and calmed further as he dropped the names of Tupac and Billie, two Cit\u00e9-Soleil gang leaders that he has known since they were children. The police took Billie from the hospital after he was shot in the gang war. Tupac was buried last week. A new Mitsubishi S.U.V. drove up. Inside were three senior gunmen with eyes like stones. They stared for a moment, nodded and drove away. The gunman with the Glock switched to flawless English with a southern drawl. He spent his teenage years in Miami and goes by the street name of Yamoska. ''Over there,'' he said, pointing to Boston, ''they were Lavalas too, but since Aristide is gone, they're our enemy.'' In the marketplace, a gang member waved his hand, and scores of women rushed forward to give testimony. They competed to praise Mr. Aristide and Dread Wilm\u00e9, the leader of the Route 9 gang. ''Dread Wilm\u00e9 is like a god for us. He protects us,'' said Emania Pierre, a market woman. Not far away, on the edge of no man's land, Bahy Joseph, 26, sat in the midday heat with her three children and elderly mother. Burned out houses and rubble-filled lots surrounded the charred, roofless hovel where she and her family have sought refuge since her house was burned. ''On Sept. 30, I saw the men coming with weapons,'' she said. ''I took my three kids and ran. My husband was coming from work. He didn't know about the trouble. He came through Boston. The gang grabbed him and killed him.'' Mrs. Joseph never found his body, but friends saw the killing. She pointed across the devastated landscape toward the other gang's turf. ''I had friends over there,'' she said. ''Now, they're my enemies.''

The brief dispatch did not describe the reasons for the riots, which local residents said involved sustained clashes between Hui Muslims and Han Chinese after a traffic accident. It gave a much lower death toll than some residents reported. One person told about an internal account of the riots, prepared for higher authorities in Beijing, that said the police had counted 148 deaths, including 18 police officers. Western news agencies reported varying death tolls, quoting local residents as saying that as many as 30 people were killed. The police prevented access to the county of Zhengmou, situated between Kaifeng and Zhengzhou in Henan Province, where much of the violence occurred. Reporters and photographers entering the area were detained and expelled. It was difficult to reach residents because phone connections appeared to have been blocked. The incident is the latest challenge for the authorities in a society that has become markedly prone to social unrest. A growing wealth gap and persistent corruption and backwardness in rural areas have fueled riots in the countryside and in secondary cities. Large-scale demonstrations, some violent, are no longer rare. Ethnic violence is less common. Hui Muslims, one of the country's 56 official ethnic groups, trace their origins to Central Asia. But they resemble Han Chinese, who make up about 90 percent of the population, and are considered well integrated into Chinese society. The details of the Henan incident remain sketchy and the number of casualties is in dispute. But it appears to have been one of the largest and most sustained ethnic clashes in many years. The violence erupted Friday after a traffic dispute pitted mostly Han residents of one village against Hui Muslims from a neighboring village. Local residents said tempers first flared after a Hui taxi driver ran over and killed a young Han girl. Relatives and fellow villagers of the girl descended on the Hui village to demand compensation. Fighting erupted, and scores of local peasants took up farm implements to battle one another. As word of the confrontation spread, Han and Hui in adjoining areas joined the fray. Several reports said as many as 500 people were involved in fighting over the weekend. Officers from the paramilitary People's Armed Police were deployed in the region and put it under martial law. Residents estimated that thousands of police officers had been deployed. The New China News Agency did not specify the number of police officers involved. A related incident may have occurred in neighboring Qi County when the police intercepted a convoy of vehicles carrying other Hui Muslims to the area. Estimates by local residents of the number of outsiders trying to join the fray were as high as several hundred. Residents described to Western news agencies a violent standoff between the Hui outsiders and police officers who stopped the convoy, with some additional deaths. An imam at a mosque inside the barricaded zone, who spoke by mobile phone, said that order had been restored but that Hui residents feared that local Han planned to continue fighting. ''The battles were intense and broke out in several places,'' the man said. ''I know of several people who died in my village and of about 10 people in another village.'' The most recent clash between Hui and other Chinese occurred in 2002, when a struggle broke out between Hui and Tibetans in western Qinghai Province. A large number of injuries were reported, but like many such incidents the matter was ignored or played down by the state-controlled media.", "title": "Ethnic Clashes Are Confirmed By Beijing; Toll Is Unclear"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/China", "Top/News/World", "Top/News/World/Asia Pacific", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia/China"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "World", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Foreign Desk", "print_page_number": "6", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/international/asia/02china.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "02CHIN$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "A 16-year-old Palestinian blew himself up on Monday in an outdoor market here, killing 3 Israelis and wounding 32 others, three days after Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, left the region for medical attention in France. The scene at the Carmel market was grisly, with scattered cartons, bits of metal and crushed fruit in pools of blood, the pungent sweet odor of guavas mixed with the rusty tang of blood and explosive. One of the dead was the owner of a clothing shop, who was filling in for her sick husband; another was a young woman who had recently gone to work selling cheese. At the clothing shop, wire hangers were bent, and a blouse still hung above the wreckage, with holes from shrapnel. The third fatality was identified as Shmuel Levy, 65, of Jaffa. ''I saw people all over the ground,'' said Dani Kanyas, 46, who sells vegetables 30 yards from the site of the explosion. ''I went toward them to help the people -- they were without hands, without arms. But there wasn't anything I could do. Every moment we breathe is a miracle.'' From a hospital near Paris, Mr. Arafat condemned the attack, which was carried out by Amr al-Far, who lived in the Askar refugee camp near Nablus, on the West Bank. The attack was also condemned by Mr. Far's mother, Samira Abdullah, 45, who said: ''It's immoral to send someone so young. They should have sent an adult who understands the meaning of his deeds.'' The last suicide bomber, who blew herself up in Jerusalem in September, was also from the Askar camp. A large number of suicide bombers, and some of the youngest, have come from Nablus and its two major refugee camps, Askar and Balata. The boy's father, Abdelrahim al-Far, 54, told Agence France-Presse: ''I was asleep this morning when Amr woke me up. He kissed me and asked for two shekels,'' about 45 cents. ''He left the house and I went back to sleep.'' Responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a militant faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which Mr. Arafat leads. The front is thought to be considerably smaller than other militant groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and some experts suggested that there would be a competition among Palestinian groups for attention in the uncertainty surrounding Mr. Arafat, who left Ramallah, on the West Bank, on Friday. But senior Israeli officials doubt that the attack on Monday was directly connected to Mr. Arafat's departure. ''This kind of suicide bombing has to be planned well in advance,'' one official said. Police officials say they believe that the bomber got his explosive belt in Ramallah, and crossed into Israel at a point where a barrier Israel is building had yet to be finished. They say they believe that the bomber was diverted from Jerusalem and sought the softer target of the Carmel market, which does not require shoppers to pass through security checks. Earlier on Monday, before the bombing, the director of the Shin Bet security service, Avi Dichter, said at a conference that suicide bombers were the worst problem facing Israel; while they represented fewer than 1 percent of militants attacking Israelis, they were responsible for 65 percent of the victims. Israel is preventing nearly three-quarters of attempted entries by would-be suicide bombers this year, he said, compared with 62 percent last year. Palestinian officials insist that Mr. Arafat is feeling better and that his condition is not life-threatening, but senior Western diplomats here say those statements cannot be taken at face value and are intended to keep the Palestinian population calm. They suggest, without knowing the actual state of his health, that Mr. Arafat is unlikely to return to Ramallah and will not be able to fulfill his leadership functions. In Ramallah on Monday, Palestinian ministers held their first cabinet meeting since Mr. Arafat left, and a meeting of the national security council. The meetings were led by the prime minister, Ahmed Qurei, who also criticized the suicide bombing, saying, ''Such attacks do not serve our cause amid such a difficult situation,'' apparently referring to Mr. Arafat's illness, ''so we call on everyone to stop targeting civilians.'' Azzam al-Ahmed, the technology minister, insisted: ''President Arafat is still in charge. We are communicating with him and there's no vacancy for power at all.'' Mr. Arafat has always been loath to give up control of the national security council, a source of friction between him and Mahmoud Abbas, who resigned as prime minister after only four months, and who is No.2 in the P.L.O. The Palestinians face critical choices about how to respond to Israel's decision to pull its settlers out of Gaza, about internal security and how to manage the peace effort, choices that will not wait forever, said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator who met with Mr. Arafat 10 days ago. The issue ''is less the succession -- a process already formalized -- and more the question of decision-making,'' Mr. Miller said. ''Who among the successors will have the legitimacy and authority to make important decisions in the months ahead?'' The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, said that ''today's terror attack proved there has been no change in the Palestinian Authority,'' and that Israel ''will not stop its war on the murderous terrorism operating against us.'' In Nablus on Monday, Israeli troops killed three wanted men in an exchange of fire in an effort to arrest five suspects belonging to Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades. A senior Israeli official said the government was planning contingencies depending on Mr. Arafat's health. ''From our point of view it would be better if he doesn't return,'' the official said. ''Arafat is an obstacle to peace and has no credibility. We want to work with a Palestinian leadership that wears a business suit, not a military uniform. The chance for businesslike leadership is a real opportunity, and we hope for a leadership not connected to terrorism, that would have credibility with Israel and the United States.'' In the Carmel market here, David Israel, 52, who sells spices and pickles, said he had seen the three dead, including the wife of the clothes seller. ''This is the will of God,'' he said. ''He was sick and couldn't come, and she replaced him and was killed. They were all my friends.'' Nearby, a vendor of onions and potatoes picked up some of his spilled produce as the volunteers of Zaka, the Orthodox volunteers in fluorescent green vests who collect body parts for burial, searched the scene. He reached down for a potato, covered in blood, then discarded it. He stared off into the distance, as if in shock, then slowly ate a sandwich.

''He expressed his concern over the situation in the south and he asked the government to consider being more lenient in dealing with the problem and to allow locals to participate in problem-solving,'' Mr. Thaksin told reporters. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, whose moral influence transcends politics here, has stepped in only at rare moments to admonish government leaders. Anger and dismay have grown in Thailand since Tuesday, when the government admitted that 78 Muslim men had died of suffocation in military trucks. They had been detained after a demonstration by 2,000 people in Narathiwait Province in which six people where shot to death. Mr. Thaksin said he had taken personal charge of the response to the demonstration. The government's initial blithe response -- that the victims had died of weakness caused by fasting during the Muslim month of Ramadan -- has fueled a surge of anger and threats of reprisals from Muslims in southern Thailand. Independent forensic examiners and survivors said the men died when they were piled on top of one another with their hands tied behind their backs and left in enclosed trucks for at least five hours. ''His majesty has urged both sides to refrain from violence -- both the government and militants who keep hurting people,'' Mr. Thaksin said. King Bhumibol, 76, is the world's longest-reigning monarch and in his usually silent and ceremonial presence embodies Thai nationhood and commands widespread reverence. Until pressured by national and international outrage, particularly from Thailand's Muslim neighbors, Mr. Thaksin had declined to apologize for the deaths or admit wrongdoing and had said the government would not change its confrontational approach in the largely Muslim south. He has since expressed regret and pledged an independent inquiry. Military commanders in the south have also told journalists they intend to continue their policy of force. That will only fuel anger and insurgency and could lead to communal violence, said Chaiwat Satha-Anan, an expert on the south at Thammasat University in Bangkok. ''We are now witnessing a further erosion of trust, and also of relations between people of different religions who have been living together,'' he said. Other commentators are warning that Thailand has, in a stroke, become a target for both local and international Islamist terrorists. ''That's what I'm afraid of,'' said Kraisak Chunhavan, a Thai senator, who traveled to the scene with a fact-finding mission. ''The Muslim reaction to this has been very strong, from Bangladesh to Indonesia.'' He said one Muslim group in Malaysia, just across the border to the south, had already warned of reprisals. Thailand received a friendly warning from Indonesia, a Muslim country that has gone down this road. ''Indonesians have learned from insurgencies in Aceh and Papua -- even though our government has not -- that ruthless violence only begets violence,'' said The Jakarta Post, an English-language daily, in an editorial. ''The strong arm of the Thai military may win battles, but only through hearts and minds will they win such a war.'' More than 400 people have died on both sides this year in the country's three southern provinces, home to most of the Muslims who make up 10 percent of this largely Buddhist nation of 63 million. Some commentators and human rights advocates in Thailand said the tension in the south had crossed a point of no return. ''This carnage has shattered the hope for peace in the deep south,'' wrote The Nation, an English-language daily. ''It has dealt a big blow to the country's image as a civilized nation. Above all, it clearly demonstrates that this government lacks the moral authority to lead the country.'' The king has in the past indirectly urged Mr. Thaksin to be more restrained and less imperious in his leadership.", "title": "Thai King Urges Premier to Be More Lenient in the Muslim South"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Thailand", "Top/News/World", "Top/News/World/Asia Pacific", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Government, Philanthropy and NGO", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia/Thailand"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "World", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Foreign Desk", "print_page_number": "3", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/international/asia/02thailand.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "02THAI$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "After a 33-year struggle, the left has finally gained power here. But if the experience of a neighboring country like Brazil is any guide, Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez and his Broad Front, narrow winners in the election on Sunday, are more likely to tinker around the edges of Uruguay's problems than carry out the profound social transformation they have been promising. Dr. V\u00e1zquez's coalition is a rather ungainly beast, ranging from Communists to Christian Democrats, and he has sought to keep its various components happy with declarations that can be interpreted in many different ways. But his victory has awakened expectations of immediate change that are likely to be fanned by those on the left, which includes former Tupamaro guerrillas. At the same time, Dr. V\u00e1zquez lacks the financial resources he needs to fulfill those promises, which in turn constrains his political maneuverability. So what will he turn out to be: an unpredictable populist like Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela, or a fiscal disciplinarian like Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil? ''As they say at bullfights, this is the hour of truth,'' said Luis Eduardo Gonz\u00e1lez, a pollster and prominent political commentator. ''There has been a lot of dubious rhetoric'' about a social revolution, he said, but if Dr. V\u00e1zquez and other Front leaders knuckle under to the harsh realities facing this country of 3.5 million, ''they will have to deny their own past history.'' One change clearly in the offing, because it has no political cost, is in relations with Washington and Wall Street. The current president, Jorge Batlle, has been widely criticized for pursuing closer ties with the United States in response to the economic collapse that hit neighboring Argentina three years ago and quickly spilled over here, nearly bringing down a financial system that had, following American advice, opened itself up to the outside world. ''It was a costly error to think that this country could ever be a kind of Luxembourg on the River Plata,'' said Senator Jos\u00e9 M\u00fajica, leader of the Front's dominant Tupamaro faction. ''That can never work, because our neighbors are Brazil and Argentina, not France and Germany.'' A week ago, the deputy United States trade negotiator, Peter Allgeier, was here to sign an investment treaty with Uruguay. But with Dr. V\u00e1zquez's victory, doubts about the future of the accord, which needs approval by a Congress in which the Front will have a majority in both houses, are suddenly being raised. ''We are not familiar with this treaty,'' Dr. V\u00e1zquez said when asked at a news conference here on Friday whether he supported the agreement. ''We will only be able to respond after we have had a chance to see and analyze it.'' And while the Front has backed away from its support of an Argentine-style default on the country's foreign debt, Dr. V\u00e1zquez has said he will insist that the International Monetary Fund ease up on Uruguay. Everyone, he said last week, needs to show ''profound social sensibility to deal with the social emergency the country faces,'' including the international community. For the most part, though, the new government is likely to follow a program of economic orthodoxy. In recent interviews, Sen. Danilo Astori, a moderate whom Dr. V\u00e1zquez has designated as his economy minister, has repeatedly said he plans to ''follow the example of Lula,'' a reference to President da Silva of Brazil and the market-friendly policies he has pursued. ''It won't be a copy of Brazil, but we also think it is possible to change the country while being prudent in managing public accounts and maintaining stability in monetary and foreign exchange policy,'' Senator Astori said in an interview here late last week. ''Uruguay is much more vulnerable than Brazil and has a much weaker economy, so we will have to be much more cautious than Brazil.'' The promise to follow Brazil's conservative fiscal example has reassured many of the money managers who feared the worst when Mr. da Silva was elected two years ago. ''Everything is normal,'' one banker said. ''Nobody is nervous, and money isn't leaving the country.'' But Mr. da Silva's example also illustrates the pitfalls of promising profound, almost immediate, change and then failing to deliver. In municipal elections on Sunday, his Workers' Party lost not only in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil's largest city and the party's birthplace, but also in Porto Alegre, a onetime stronghold where the Workers' Party had been in power for 16 years. ''The front has to carry out the program it promised us,'' said Mar\u00eda Antonia Bello, 66, a widow who has seen the value of her pension reduced drastically by the economic crisis. ''If not, the people will protest, and when it comes time to vote again, we will throw them out. We're not going to accept another neoliberal government, indifferent to people's social needs.'' But it is precisely the restoration of those health, education and housing benefits cut by past governments that will be most difficult to carry out. ''We have criticized things that we are going to have to carry out ourselves,'' Mr. Astori acknowledged. ''It's going to be just like in Brazil.'' No need to worry; the situation is manageable, argues Mr. M\u00fajica, who is expected to be appointed production minister, overseeing activities ranging from agriculture to industry. After waiting a generation for the front to assume power, he said, most of its supporters on the traditional left do not expect miracles and can be persuaded to be patient. ''This supposed dichotomy is a bit puerile and simplistic,'' he said. ''What people outside our coalition don't understand is that even though we have built a culture of diversity of opinion over the past 30 years, when we make a decision, we carry it out. If the day comes when there is something I can't accept, then I will go home.''

Virtually everyone here has something at stake, from Iraqi contractors and day laborers who work for the American military, to parents who want to send their children safely to school each day, to mujahedeen. Nearly all of them have opinions on the cosmic question of the day: Kerry or Bush? And in a way that would seem not at all out of place in the aisles of a Wal-Mart in Cleveland or beside a gas pump in Fort Lauderdale, a fair portion of the opinion here is overwhelmingly partisan and delivered with absolute certainty. ''If I had enough money,'' said Razzaq al-Asadi, a worker in the holy city of Karbala, ''I would have built a statue for President Bush in one of Baghdad's squares to express our gratitude for ending Saddam's era.'' The Iraqi partisans for Senator John Kerry are no less sure of themselves, although many seem motivated as much by a deep dislike of Mr. Bush as by affection for his challenger. ''We all know that Bush is vicious,'' said Muhammad Sharif, an electrical engineer in Mosul, before giving his decidedly more lukewarm endorsement of Kerry: ''I hope that Kerry has enough intelligence to run things in the right way.'' A poll of 2,000 people by the Iraq Center for Research and Strategic Studies showed that Iraqis who had an opinion on the two candidates were evenly divided. If Iraq really were a swing state, a possible danger sign for the president would be the number of people who seem to have shifted their allegiance from him since the invasion toppled Saddam Hussein last year. Saad Shakir Tawfiq, a nuclear scientist in Baghdad who was under virtual house arrest for years under Mr. Hussein, said he was euphoric when the Americans forced the dictator out. Then, as the streets of his city became deadlier by the week, his views on Mr. Bush began to change. ''I feel very bad about this,'' Dr. Tawfiq said. ''If I were an American, I would definitely vote against him.'' Dr. Tawfiq said the American-led conflict in Iraq had been ''mismanaged from top to bottom.'' As long as Iraqis avoided criticism of Mr. Hussein and his family, they could survive on the streets, he said. Now, he said: ''We lost everything. Everything is worse to me.'' Although Dr. Tawfiq may not be a typical political animal here -- his sister is a Kerry fund-raiser in Cleveland -- his sentiments are echoed widely. ''I'm very grateful to Bush and his administration and what they've done for Iraq,'' said Kamel Chadirji, a ministry official in Baghdad. ''All my life I will be grateful to him. But I will vote for Kerry,'' inadvertently speaking as if he really could go to the polls on Tuesday. To be sure, there are pockets of support for each candidate in Iraq, just as there are in the United States. The fortress-like Green Zone on the western shore of the Tigris River, for instance, with thousands of Iraqis who make their livelihoods working directly for the Americans, is a Bush bastion. Areas that are on the other side of the American military's guns, as in the rebel-held town of Falluja, are a different story entirely. Sheik Khalid al-Jumaili, the chief negotiator representing the people of Falluja in talks aimed at averting an imminent American-led invasion, at first said the elections would change nothing for the town either way. But then he warmed to the topic. ''If there is the slightest possibility of a change in the policy in Iraq,'' he said, ''then we pray to God that Kerry wins. We have suffered enough and we need a change in policies.'' He is far from the only resident of Falluja to feel that way. Of eight men at a recent gathering of former soldiers, tribal leaders and intellectuals at a home in Falluja, six said they hoped Mr. Kerry would win. ''The policy of Bush was one of violence and war, and we don't think Bush will change that,'' said a former officer in the Iraqi Army. ''Maybe Kerry will be wiser. Even if he doesn't withdraw the American forces, maybe he'll reduce the violence. Even people in America now think that because of Bush's policy, others in the world have taken an aggressive view against America.'' The poor and rundown Baghdad district of Sadr City is a place where Bush-Cheney bumper stickers would be ill-advised. A half-dozen followers of Moktada al-Sadr, the rebel Shiite cleric, recently confronted an American reporter and photographer in a home there. The militiamen had just learned that the journalists were American and, their faces flushed with surprise and anger, conducted a quick test to see if they could trust them. ''Bush or Kerry?'' asked a mid-level official named Muhammad. The photographer said neither choice appeared good, an answer that inspired even harder looks from the men. The debate over the two candidates brought complicated arguments from some quarters. Abdul Salaam al-Kubaisi, a senior member of the Muslim Scholars Association, a group of Sunni clerics that claims to represent 3,000 mosques and has close ties to the insurgency, said the association had come up with an unofficial endorsement. ''Both of them are bad and evil,'' Mr. Kubaisi said. ''But we want Kerry to win because we want Bush to lose his coalition. ''But personally,'' he said, ''I hope Bush will win rather than Kerry. I don't want the American people to topple Bush; I want the Iraqi people to topple him.'' Other Iraqis come off as dream endorsements for one side or other, reinforcing exactly the messages that the candidates have been trying to put across in the United States. ''Mr. George W. Bush,'' said Adel Naji, an Iraqi journalist attending a conference in the Green Zone, when asked which side he favored. ''I can say what I want in Iraq,'' Mr. Naji said in English, praising Mr. Bush's victory over Mr. Hussein's repressive government. ''Just a little trouble in my life -- no safety. But this is not important things. I have my freedom; that is enough.'' For others, the choice turns on simpler considerations. ''A crazy guy whom you know is better than a sane guy you do not know,'' said Muhammad Yehia, a merchant in Mosul. ''That is why I prefer Bush. I don't know anything about Kerry.'' Without declaring his own allegiance, Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said Iraqi officials were awaiting the results with bated breath, even as they took tiny steps toward taking part in their own first democratic elections, scheduled for January. ''Everything is on hold until the American elections take place,'' he said. The citizens here wait, and debate, along with America, turning each consideration this way and that. But there is at least one term in the political equation on Tuesday that draws entirely blank stares. In Mahmudiya, at a training base for police and national guard recruits, the young men bandied about ''Boosh'' and ''Kay-rrrie'' endlessly, stopping only when an American photographer found a surefire way to fend off queries about his allegiance. He told them he was voting for Ralph Nader.

Soon, the young Lebanese teacher says, he found himself in a safe house in Baghdad, with a long list of Saudis and Kuwaitis ahead of him waiting to become suicide bombers. Tired of waiting, he cadged an assignment in Falluja and learned Iraqi slang so he could travel there from Baghdad without attracting attention. But the Iraqis in Falluja eventually suggested that he and all of the mujahedeen with him in a safe house there return home. Arab governments and Western intelligence officials express growing concern that Iraq is becoming the training ground that Afghanistan was in the 1980's, breeding another generation of fanatical warriors ready to carry their jihad back home. Interviews with mujahedeen are rare. The violence inside Iraq makes them inaccessible; many die in the fighting and those who return face imprisonment if their own governments discover what they have done. But on Friday afternoon, here in this notorious outlaw valley in eastern Lebanon, the teacher, a handsome 32-year-old Sunni Muslim with a neatly trimmed brown beard and a stocky build, agreed to describe his odyssey into jihad. He agreed on the condition that neither his name nor his village be mentioned. In September, some half a dozen men from a Bekaa village called Majdal Anjar were among more than 35 arrested on various terrorism charges, including encouraging young men to fight in Iraq. One suspect from there died under interrogation. As the light on the barren, dusty Anti-Lebanon mountain range soaring above the village changed to a deep purple sunset, the well-spoken teacher, dressed in jeans and a plaid shirt, sat on a low couch in the office of his local cleric, who vouched for him and said he knew of other young men who had made the trip. He described his experiences last winter in convincing detail. Much of what he said confirms the broad outlines of what many military analysts suggest: that the hard-to-quantify Arab volunteers are a contributing factor, especially in suicide bombings, but Iraqis run the resistance. Before leaving for Iraq, he said, he first studied at an ad hoc academy for jihad. The classes, under clerical tutelage, gave some of the many men from the area who wanted to fight an understanding of the religious basis for expelling infidel invaders from Muslim lands. ''I wasn't allowed to go just like that,'' he said. ''I had to agree with the idea of jihad, with the ideology behind it, before I was ready to act. It wasn't enough just to say I want to go be a martyr; I had to know why.'' The teacher said he had particularly been struck by several statements from the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi -- who has claimed responsibility for a series of beheadings, bombings and other grisly acts that have made him the most wanted terrorist in Iraq -- saying there was no need to carry the fight to the United States itself when so many targets were available on occupied Arab land. ''Zarqawi addressed himself to all Muslim youth, saying that the Americans have come and come with all their armies, they attacked us, so we should go ourselves to take our revenge,'' the teacher said. He sidestepped questions about whether he had encountered Mr. Zarqawi in Falluja, noting only that all fighters adopted guerrilla aliases of Abu So-And-So, making it next to impossible to know the strangers with whom he had shared safe houses. But the teacher denied that he himself was motivated by the desire to kill. ''I decided on jihad because I wanted to stop the occupation, not out of the love of blood,'' he said. His anger was fed by almost daily scenes on television of Iraqi women and children dying, not to mention Palestinians suffering the same fate. Similar fury percolates throughout the region. A reporter entering a money exchange shop in the Bekaa village of Masnaa, a frenetic crossroads right on the Syrian-Lebanese border, was asked if he was American and then was handed a pamphlet filled with gory pictures of dead children, burned bodies and photographs of soldiers torturing Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison. ''Where Are the Men?'' shouted the headline above the pictures. ''Who Will Avenge Our Dignity?'' The money changer said many men in the region had long dreamed of joining the Palestinians fighting Israel, but that border is impenetrable. The road to Iraq is open, he noted, and killing American soldiers is the next best thing. The tract's 16 pages brimmed with outrage over the results of the American invasion, mocking the idea that it would spur democracy when it was obviously intended to control Iraqi oil and neuter Israel's only real Arab foe. ''I think those who can fight should fight -- Lebanese, Arabs, everyone,'' said Maan Bashur, a main organizer behind the Civic Campaign to Support Palestine and Iraq, saying a member group had distributed some 30,000 of the pamphlets throughout Lebanon. ''But this campaign is not about military support,'' he added. The Bush administration has pressed Syria and other neighboring countries to seal their borders to try to bar foreign militants. Recent reports of arrests near Iraq's borders show that some of those efforts are succeeding, but also that the flow continues. Saudi press reports last week said four men in their 30's had been arrested trying to breach the northern border near Hafr al Batan, while a national guard lieutenant who deserted to join the jihad had died in a suicide operation in Iraq. At least five Kuwaitis, including a military officer arrested in Syria in the past few months, were deported, and the Kuwaiti newspaper Al Rai al Am reported last week that they included a teenager carrying a letter affirming his ''pure jihad'' intentions. Kuwait's ambassador to Damascus, Suleiman Ibrahim al-Murjan, says he believes that there is a kind of regional underground railroad funneling fighters to Iraq. ''There is no doubt that there are some people whose main task is to push others,'' he said. ''There has to be somebody who is paying for them. There has to be somebody who is bringing them to Iraq, somebody who is receiving them.'' Stealing into Iraq, the Lebanese teacher said, was merely a matter of money. He paid an Iraqi smuggler $500 of his $1,500 in savings to include him in a group that was guided over the border. The teacher tried to look clean-cut for the trip, so that from a distance nobody would suspect he was a mujahid. ''There were patrols, lots of patrols, and whenever we saw the Americans we would hit the dirt,'' he said. To their dismay, the men discovered that some kind of desert bird slept on the ground at night, so whenever they dropped onto the sand, the birds would flap and screech, scaring the insurgents and making them fear discovery by the American patrols even more. The teacher said an eight-hour delay in the crossing had made him miss his rendezvous with the Iraqi insurgents who were to guide him to Baghdad, so he had called back to Lebanon to arrange another meeting. Once in the Iraqi capital, he said, he was put in a room in a house with sealed windows with roughly 15 other Arabs, including men from Libya, Egypt, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. ''There are three ways of targeting the enemy,'' he said the Iraqi in charge of the group had told them. ''One was to plant a roadside bomb, but I had no experience with that. The second was to shoot at patrols, and although I had some experience with weapons, I had not done military service and did not know that much about them. The third and best jihad was to drive a car into the enemy.'' He volunteered to steer a vehicle into any United States military target, but did not want to kill Iraqis -- even Iraqi soldiers. After a week doing nothing he asked to go somewhere else and was transferred to Falluja. He again shaved his beard, and in the taxi on the way he threw out occasional greetings like ''Sha ku ma ku?'' -- Iraqi slang for ''What's happening?'' -- so no one would denounce him as a foreigner. In Falluja he was taken to another sealed house, where he spent some time with a rotating group of Arab fighters, including two experienced guerrillas who had traveled across Iran from Afghanistan and were directing some operations. The Arabs were told that if they wanted to fight Americans, they would have to pay $200 for their military kit, including a machine gun, rocket-propelled grenade launcher and 10 hand grenades. They also had to pay for food. He said they all took turns buying dinner, although there were several well-to-do Saudis in the house who had plenty of money and often insisted on treating. Eventually the owner of the house, a newlywed who had sent his bride back to his mother, complained that there were so many men that the house might attract unwanted notice, bringing American bombs down on their heads. He told the men that if they really wanted to help, they would donate whatever money they had and return home to raise funds and support for the Iraqi resistance. The teacher said that after a few calm weeks he decided to come home, although he says he now regrets it because he recognized some of the men he had been with in news reports on suicide operations. ''After seeing the land and the people in Iraq, after seeing what I saw and feeling what I felt, I should be there,'' he said. ''I shouldn't have come back.''

In telephone calls to Reuters and The Associated Press, Mullah Es Haq Manzoor, a spokesman who describes himself as the military commander of the group, Jaish-e-Muslimeen, repeated his threat that the hostages would be killed if a rescue attempt was made. ''We have separated the three hostages and are keeping them far from each other so that in case one is discovered by the authorities, we have the chance to kill the other two,'' Reuters quoted Mr. Manzoor as saying. An American soldier was also killed and two were wounded Monday in an attack in southeastern Afghanistan, where the United States has a base close to the Pakistani border, The A.P. reported, quoting an American military spokesman, Maj. Mark McCann. The three hostages were abducted in Kabul on Thursday. Jaish-e-Muslimeen, or Army of Muslims, claimed responsibility very quickly and has made repeated calls to news agencies in the days since to lay out conditions. On Sunday, the leader of the group, Akbar Agha, said the three would be killed if his demands -- that United Nations and foreign military forces withdraw from Afghanistan, and that the hostages' home countries denounce the presence of the foreign troops -- were not met by Wednesday. The three hostages -- a British-Irish woman, Annetta Flanigan; a Kosovo Albanian woman, Shqipe Habibi; and a Filipino diplomat working for the United Nations, Angelito Nayan -- were shown on a video released to the Arab network Al Jazeera on Sunday. The three were sitting together on the floor against a wall, watched by a guard whose head and face were hidden by a checkered scarf. Mr. Manzoor also said his group was in contact with the Afghan government and the United Nations through a businessman acting as a mediator, Reuters reported. A government official said the first tentative leads to make contact with the hostage takers were coming together. Officials are hoping to use tribal, religious and factional contacts to try to reach the kidnappers, who are thought to be a local gang with connections inside Kabul, and who may be separate from the men making the phone calls.

But Madison Avenue, public relations agencies and big corporate advertisers are already trying to divine lessons from the long, expensive contest for the White House. Here are some they are discussing. ACT NOW -- RIGHT NOW -- Product marketers must follow their political counterparts in acknowledging that a constant flow of information has virtually replaced the 24-hour news cycle, executives said. ''We have to think like every day is Election Day,'' said Linda Kaplan Thaler, chief executive and chief creative officer at the Kaplan Thaler Group in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe. ''We need to force ourselves -- all of us, advertisers, people in the business -- to put very, very stringent deadlines on everything we do.'' Inaction seemed to hurt Mr. Kerry when he remained silent after a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth began questioning the severity of the wounds he received in Vietnam and his subsequent antiwar activities. BLOGS ARE BIG -- Web logs, or blogs, seemed to grow their adult teeth when their authors received press passes to the national party conventions. Despite their partisan nature, they became a source of information for many political aficionados, in many cases at the expense of the traditional media, said Nick Hahn, managing director at Vivaldi Partners in New York, a strategy, marketing and brand consulting company. ''The blogs don't market themselves,'' Mr. Hahn said. ''People self-select the blogs they read.'' For that reason, they may be particularly effective ways to reach younger consumers, who often dislike having products sold to them but enjoy feeling that they have discovered something for themselves. Some marketers are already experimenting with the form. Since last month, General Motors has been posting a blog devoted to a type of engine, known as the small block, that it developed 50 years ago for Chevrolets. Nike and others have hired Denton Media, the operator of eight gossipy blogs like Gawker and Wonkette, to create custom blogs. Ad agencies like Butler, Shine, Stern & Partners in Sausalito, Calif., and Yellowfin Direct Marketing in Boston have started blogs of their own. STAND BY YOUR BRAND -- ''When advertising a brand, you want to be consistent,'' said Ron Lawner, chairman and chief creative officer at Arnold Worldwide in Boston, part of Havas, which creates ads for clients like Volkswagen of America and the Bermuda Department of Tourism. The candidates hurt themselves by failing the consistency test, he said. ''One minute they're nasty, the next minute they're apple pie and mom.'' Kathy Delaney, executive creative director and managing partner at the New York office of Deutsch, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, said that consistency was crucial. ''Too many brands out there flip-flop about that, to use a term that's been applied to one of the candidates,'' she said. ''If you start doing something different, people don't believe it.'' KFC might have heeded that advice last year, when it tried to sell its fried chicken as healthier than consumers might have thought. That campaign soon ended, and now KFC is back to aiming at its core customer who loves fried chicken for its taste. The latest ads call KFC ''Chicken Capital USA.'' LOYALTY IS ROYALTY -- Consumer brands can learn from the way the presidential campaigns viewed voters this year, less by demographics or psychographics than by loyalty, said Mr. Hahn, the Vivaldi Partners executive. Rather than categorizing potential supporters exclusively by sex or income, the campaigns sorted them into groups like ''soft supporters, fence-sitters and soft rejecters,'' Mr. Hahn said. Product marketers spend enormous amounts of time and money trying to convert people who are devoted fans of rival brands, but the candidates were able to ignore such ''hard rejecters'' and channel their resources to more fruitful purposes. FORGET THE BOX -- ''Gone are the days when you would say to people, 'think outside the box,' because in essence there is no box anymore,'' said Ms. Thaler. ''We need to work more by chaos theory than by linear thinking.'' Ms. Thaler said that in an era awash in information (and misinformation), all the variables that might once have been incidental to a political campaign or a marketer have become potentially significant. Not that separating the important from the ephemeral is getting any easier. For example, the Subservient Chicken Web site run by Burger King, which is meant to promote a type of chicken sandwich, is being parodied by a site called Subservient President, with results impossible to gauge. The parody invites visitors to give orders to a man wearing a mask of President Bush. ''Get politics just the way corporate America likes it,'' the site says. ''Type a command.'' (The site includes a link to the real Subservient Chicken site.) ''We're seeing a genuine form of cross-pollination that serves the interests of both the advertising community and people who want to inject art or politics into popular culture,'' said Steve Anderson, a research assistant professor of interactive media at the University of Southern California who created the parody site. The lessons, of course, will grow clearer -- once a winner is declared.

Southwest said that beginning in January, it would add the flights to 13 cities that it already served from Midway. The announcement came a week after ATA filed for bankruptcy protection. At the same time, ATA said it would sell its operations at Midway and gates at La Guardia Airport in New York and Reagan National Airport in Washington to AirTran Airways for $87.6 million. Southwest, the nation's sixth-largest airline; ATA, the 10th largest; and AmericaWest Airlines, which is 12th biggest, are all discount carriers. Last week, the chief executive of Southwest, Gary Kelly, said the airline would significantly expand at Midway, its fourth-biggest airport and its most important hub. Currently, Southwest has 145 flights a day from Midway, and 2,900 employees. It started service at Midway in 1985 with seven flights a day. Southwest said it would add two flights a day from Midway to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale in Florida, and to Manchester, N.H. It will add one flight a day to Las Vegas; Raleigh, N.C.; Tampa; Los Angeles; Oakland; Phoenix; Seattle; Providence, R.I.; Philadelphia; and Columbus, Ohio. The flights will start in January, February and March, depending on the city. Southwest also plans to add 29 new Boeing 737's to its fleet next year, one reason the airline is able to increase its schedules. It said it would operate the additional flights out of its 19 gates at Midway. But some analysts say Southwest might make an offer for some of ATA's 14 gates at Midway, so that it could expand even further. Also, America West, another low-fare carrier, said it might be interested in buying all of ATA, including its operations at Midway. Any deal for ATA's assets would require approval from the United States Bankruptcy Court, from the City of Chicago and from a federal loan board. America West and ATA each have outstanding balances on federally backed loans. The ratings agency Standard & Poor's said yesterday that it was changing its outlook for America West from neutral to negative, meaning it could cut the airline's debt rating if conditions do not improve.

The losses were widespread, with two-thirds of papers reporting flat or declining circulation, including The Washington Post and The Daily News, according to an analysis by the Newspaper Association of America of figures released yesterday by the Audit Bureau of Circulations. And the industry's decline was more evident on Sundays. The average daily circulation for the nation's 841 daily newspapers fell 0.9 percent, to 47,711,751, for the six months ended Sept. 30, as compared with the period a year earlier, according to the newspaper association. For those 662 papers that publish Sundays, the drop over the same period was 1.5 percent, to 51,625,241, according to the association's analysis. Over the last decade, newspaper circulation has generally declined in the face of competition from the Internet and other sources. ''We see results that aren't a heck of a lot different from what we've seen over time,'' said John F. Sturm, president and chief executive of the newspaper association. But hopes that the decline had bottomed out -- expressed at this time last year when daily circulation for the six months ended in September was reported to have grown slightly -- may be misplaced. The results were the first that the audit bureau has released since four newspapers, beginning in June, reported they had inflated their circulation. Two of those papers, Newsday and Hoy, a Spanish-language daily, are owned by Tribune Company, which said last week that in response, another of its publications, The Los Angeles Times, had taken a more cautious approach to counting its paid circulation. That approach contributed to a 5.6 percent decline in daily circulation at The Los Angeles Times, to 902,164, and a 6.3 percent decline in Sunday circulation, to 1,292,274. Another of the company's papers, The Chicago Tribune, reported that its average weekday circulation fell 2 percent, to 600,988, and that its Sunday circulation dropped 3.8 percent, to 963,927. But declines of that magnitude were more the exception than the rule, said Edward J. Atorino, managing director of Fulcrum Global Partners, an independent research firm. The industry, he added, could breathe easier knowing that it had passed relatively unscathed through a reporting period that was generally acknowledged to be critical. ''The fears of some massive circulation decline were just overwrought,'' said Mr. Atorino, who said his firm had no investments in newspapers or other media companies. ''The downward trend in circulation is continuing, but it's not a major new downtrend.'' Among the nation's large papers reporting declines, The Washington Post. said that its average weekday circulation fell 3 percent, to 707,690, and 1.8 percent on Sundays, to 1.007 million. Boisfeuillet Jones Jr., publisher and chief executive, did not return a phone call late yesterday afternoon seeking comment. Among the major papers that experienced an increase in paid readership was USA Today, which reported that its average daily circulation had increased 2.8 percent, to 2.31 million. A spokesman for the newspaper, Steven Anderson, cited increased sales in the travel market. The New York Times also reported increases, with its average circulation increasing 0.2 percent on weekdays, to 1.12 million, as well as on Sundays, to 1.68 million. Few papers experienced the growth of The New York Post, which continued to narrow its gap, at least on weekdays, with The Daily News. The average weekday readership of The Post rose 5.2 percent, to 686,207, while that of The News fell 1.6 percent, to 715,052. The gap between the publications is now fewer than 30,000 papers on weekdays. The Post, however, charges half the price of The News from Monday through Friday. ''Our growth has primarily been in New York City, the five boroughs, and nearby,'' said Col Allan, editor in chief of The Post. ''People are voting with their feet, or should I say, their change.'' But while the average Sunday circulation of The News fell, by 2 percent, to 786,952, the paper still holds a formidable lead over The Post, which rose, by 4.2 percent, to 455,511.", "title": "Newspaper Circulation Continues to Decline"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/Business", "Top/News/Business/Media and Advertising", "Top/News"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Business", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Business/Financial Desk", "print_page_number": "7", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "C", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/business/media/02paper.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "02PAPE$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Ezra Stoller, a celebrated architectural photographer whose work introduced the viewing public to the high modernism of the postwar era, died on Friday at his home in Williamstown, Mass. He was 89. The cause was complications of a recent stroke, his daughter, Erica, said. Trained as an architect, Mr. Stoller photographed most of the important buildings of the 1950's and 60's, including Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum, Eero Saarinen's T.W.A. Terminal and Louis I. Kahn's Salk Institute for Biological Studies. ''He had a pretty deep appreciation of the kinds of strengths of modern architecture: simplicity, proportion, balance,'' William S. Saunders, the author of ''Modern Architecture: Photographs by Ezra Stoller'' (Abrams, 1990), said in a telephone interview. ''He was dedicated to showing buildings in the best possible way.'' Mr. Stoller was not merely a documenter but also an interpreter of buildings, translating an architect's three-dimensional vision into two-dimensional abstract compositions that had a sweeping beauty of their own. Famous for his ability to capture a building from just the right angle and in just the right light, he was often commissioned by the world's leading architects, who spoke, in hopeful tones, of having their creations ''Stollerized.'' ''I see my work in a way that is analogous to a musician given a score to play who must bring it to life and make the piece as good as it can be,'' said Mr. Stoller, in an interview quoted in a brochure about a current show of his work at the Williams College Museum of Art. ''While I cannot make a bad building good, I can draw out the strengths in a work that has strength.'' Shooting primarily in black and white and using a large-format camera, Mr. Stoller laid meticulous groundwork, often spending days watching the light move across the surface of a building before he ever clicked the shutter. ''He would almost 'stalk' the building and approach it from every angle and make all these diagrams,'' said Deborah Rothschild, the curator of ''Ezra Stoller: Architectural Photography,'' on view at Williams through Dec. 19. ''That, combined with a natural gift for composition and clarity, enabled him to get just the right vantage point.'' The resulting images, published widely in newspapers and magazines as well as in architectural books, were praised for their crispness, sharp tonal contrast and cool, controlled stance. Because Mr. Stoller's work was portable in a way that his subjects could never be, it was often the only way for far-flung viewers to experience the buildings of titans like Wright, Marcel Breuer, I.M. Pei, Philip Johnson, Richard Meier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Mr. Stoller received the Architectural Photography Medal from the American Institute of Architects in 1961. Mr. Stoller's images reflected his own aesthetic sensibility, but they also communicated something vital about the architect's. Photographing at the Guggenheim, he resisted the natural temptation to climb to the top of the museum's inverted ziggurat and shoot the gallery below. Instead, his photograph looks dizzyingly upward, flattening the famous whorls into an abstract form that suggests a chambered nautilus. ''He captures this whole spiral, and you see the organic inspiration for most of Wright's work,'' Ms. Rothschild said. Photographing the Salk Institute in San Diego, Mr. Stoller maneuvered himself into an awkward position in order to catch what Ms. Rothschild described as ''the almost Cubistic way the building works.'' Ezra Stoller was born on May 16, 1915, in Chicago. He received a bachelor's degree in 1938 from the School of Architecture and Allied Arts at New York University. During World War II he taught photography at the Army Signal Corps Photo Center in New York. In 1966 he founded the photo agency Esto Photographics, which represents his work and that of other architectural photographers. Besides his daughter, of Rye, N.Y., Mr. Stoller is survived by his wife, the former Helen Rubin; two sons, Evan, of New Lebanon, N.Y., and Lincoln, of Shokan, N.Y.; five grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. Interviewed about his craft, Mr. Stoller tended to deflect critical praise. ''Architecture, being a sensory experience, must be interpreted through a sensory medium,'' he told The New York Times in 1991. ''I never claimed that my work is art. The art is the architecture.''", "title": "Ezra Stoller, Who Captured Modern Buildings, Dies at 89"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/Features/Arts", "Top/News/Obituaries", "Top/Features/Arts/Art and Design", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Activities and Interests/Architecture"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Arts; Obituaries", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "print_page_number": "15", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "C", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/arts/design/02stoller.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "02STOL$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "The Food and Drug Administration said Monday that producers of olive oil could say on their labels that there was ''limited and not conclusive'' evidence that people could reduce the risk of coronary disease by replacing saturated fats in their diets with olive oil. It is only the third time that the agency has approved such a qualified health claim for a food label. The other two foods approved for such health claims were walnuts and omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish like salmon and tuna. Until last year, the only health claims that food producers were permitted to make were those for which there was ''significant scientific agreement,'' like calcium's role in preventing osteoporosis. Producers will now be able to say on their labels: ''Limited and not conclusive scientific evidence suggests that eating about two tablespoons (23 grams) of olive oil daily may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease due to the monounsaturated fat in olive oil. To achieve this possible benefit, olive oil is to replace a similar amount of saturated fat and not increase the total number of calories you eat in a day.'' Scientists have also found that polyunsaturated oils and other monounsaturated oils, besides olive oil, can reduce the risk of heart disease. But the agency said that only olive oil producers had asked the government to be able to make that claim. Dr. Meir Stampfer, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, said the decision showed the agency had adjusted its opinion about healthful diets. ''In the past,'' Dr. Stampfer said, ''they declined to give any cardiovascular health claim for anything that was not low fat. Now they are recognizing that the idea that fat is bad as guidance for health is a concept that we should have moved away from long ago.'' ''We always have to think about diet as replacement,'' he added, ''the basic idea of healthy, relative to something.'' But Bonnie Liebman, director of nutrition for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a group that often criticizes the government and food companies, said, ''The way the regulations are written, they allow too much saturated and trans fats in a food that will be marketed as good for your heart.'' In addition, Ms. Liebman said, qualified health claims will confuse people.

Now in its fifth week, this labor dispute threatens to tarnish San Francisco's self-described reputation as ''Everyone's Favorite City.'' Workers are at odds with their managers, and city leaders are at odds with hotel owners. Mayor Gavin Newsom said he was so frustrated by the continuing lockout last week that he briefly joined a picket line to show owners his solidarity with the union. An industry trade group, the Hotel Council of San Francisco, publicly denounced his actions. And caught in the cross-fire are the city's treasured tourists. Guests at San Francisco landmark hotels like the Intercontinental Mark Hopkins, the Sheraton Palace and The Fairmont have nervously crossed picket lines, settled for reduced services, endured shouts and taunts and exchanged pillow mints for earplugs. ''I feel sorry for the workers, I feel sorry for the hotel owners and I feel sorry for me,'' said Stephanie DeMars, a visitor from Texas and guest at the Westin St. Francis in fashionable Union Square The contract in question expired in August, setting in motion talks between Unite Here Local 2, the union representing the city's 8,000 hotel workers, including the 4,300 members locked out, and the operators of some of San Francisco's largest, four-star hotels, represented by the San Francisco Multi-Employer Group. Classic bread-and-butter issues were on the table, including wage increases, costs of health benefits, pension changes, a right-to-organize clause and the length of the contract. But talks stalled in September when the union balked at proposed health and pension concessions and hotels refused to discuss the concerns until Local 2 dropped its quest for a two-year contract, to expire in 2006. That is when contracts will expire in nine other cities, including Boston, Chicago and New York. The unions reason that if all 10 cities can negotiate simultaneously, it will give labor the kind of bargaining chip it needs to do battle with the multinational corporations that own the nation's best hotels. ''They are attempting to nationalize the unions,'' said Matthew Adams, vice president of both the hotel negotiating group and the Hyatt Regency here. ''It would cripple our industry and we're simply not going to stand for it.'' To protest the unbudging stance of the hotel group, union workers initiated a two-week strike at four hotels on Sept. 29. Two days later, the 14 hotels retaliated with a lockout. The mayor called last week for a 90-day cooling off period but the hotels, now using replacement workers, refused to let employees return, even though the union strike ended as planned. ''We've never seen this kind of action from the hotels,'' Mayor Newsom said. ''It sends a terrible message to the rest of the country that there is unrest here.'' The mayor, saying that the hotels were ''putting a gun to the head of the city,'' called the lockout a ''huge mistake.'' Michael Casey, president of Local 2, called the continued lockout ''indefensible and unconscionable.'' ''We have said repeatedly that all items are negotiable,'' Mr. Casey said. ''The best thing for the big hotels, the members and the city is to accept a cooling off period and end the lockout.'' Union workers on the picket line last week said they were particularly unhappy with proposed wage increases, calling it ''insulting.'' The union is seeking an increase of 55 cents an hour for each year of a two-year contract for untipped workers and an increase of 45 cents for workers who receive tips. Management has offered an annual wage increase of 20 cents an hour per year for five years, while employees who receive tips would receive an annual raise of 5 cents an hour. The union contends the hotels' proposal would not compensate workers for the extra contribution employers want toward medical costs. Medical contributions for most employees, who now pay $10 per person per month, would gradually increase to $40 per person per month over five years. And the proposed change in eligibility requirements would leave 1,100 families without health benefits, the union said. The hotels declined to give a number, but said it was substantially lower than the union's estimate and they have asked the union to substantiate its claim. Mr. Adams of the hotel group said the hotels had little choice but to seek concessions, given the exploding cost of health care. The hotel group said five-year projections suggested that hotel employers would pay in total an additional $2.6 million a month just to cover San Francisco workers. ''We're not an unlimited resource,'' Mr. Adams said. ''We're simply looking for some level of employee participation.'' He added that with California's new worker compensation laws and tax increases, ''The cost of doing business in San Francisco is tremendous.'' Workers on the picket line at The Fairmont and The Mark Hopkins last week said they were all too familiar with the high cost of living in San Francisco, especially on a wage of $14 to $22 an hour. Reva James-Frye, 53, a city resident and telephone operator at the Fairmont for 15 years, earns nearly $15 an hour, or about $33,000 a year. Roughly half of her paycheck goes toward rent. ''I can barely make ends meet now,'' Ms. James-Frye said. ''What is the point of getting a little 20-cent raise if it's going to go back in their pockets to cover health benefits.'' Guillermina Tremillo, 27, a single mother of a 2-year-old, works two jobs to make ends meet, both at the famed Top of the Mark restaurant. Ms. Tremillo also shares a home with her entire family, including her parents and five sisters, all of whom pool wages. But four of her sisters work at San Francisco hotels and they too have been locked out. ''My feelings are very hurt,'' Ms. Tremillo said. ''I do two jobs so they save one person with me. They make money with me. You give and give the most you can and they just don't care.'' Mr. Adams said, however, that management wanted the employees to return to work. ''A contract can be had in fairly quick order if we can resolve the issue of term,'' he said. The city has already lost business because of the dispute. The American Anthropological Association, for example, decided to move its November conference to Atlanta in support of the union, a decision that has cost the city $3.2 million, according to the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau. With hotel management and the unions so far apart on several issues, the two sides are not expected to reach a contract agreement soon. The union late last week heard that workers would be eligible for unemployment benefits, which the union said could allow workers to withstand the lockout for up to six months. Locked out workers from the Sheraton Palace flew to Waikiki on Friday to set up picket lines and a one-day action at two other Sheraton hotels there, ''to deliver the message that we won't be isolated to San Francisco,'' said Mr. Casey of Local 2. And San Francisco has received a show of support from hotel unions negotiating in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., where strikes have been authorized but not initiated. ''The point is to get everyone together,'' Ms. James-Frye said. ''There's strength in numbers.''", "title": "Lockout at Top Hotels Mars Tourism in San Francisco"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/U.S.", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/California", "Top/News/U.S./West", "Top/News", "Top/News/World/Asia Pacific", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Hospitality, Restaurant and Travel", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/California/San Francisco", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/California"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "U.S.", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "National Desk", "print_page_number": "16", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/national/02hotels.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "02HOTE$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "The director of central intelligence has asked the C.I.A.'s inspector general to modify a draft report on the Sept. 11 attacks to avoid drawing conclusions about whether individual C.I.A. officers should be held accountable for any failures, Congressional and intelligence officials said Monday. The request by Porter J. Goss, the intelligence chief, would affect an 800-page report that is the result of nearly two years of work. Congressional officials said they were reviewing Mr. Goss's request, spelled out in an Oct. 27 memorandum to the inspector general, John Helgerson, to determine whether it was consistent with a request by the joint Congressional committee that looked into the Sept. 11 attacks. That panel asked in December 2002 that the Central Intelligence Agency's inspector general determine ''whether and to what extent personnel at all levels should be held accountable'' for any mistakes that contributed to the failure to disrupt the attacks. Mr. Helgerson's draft report is widely understood to identify officers and officials who should be considered for discipline because of breakdowns in the collection, analysis and distribution of intelligence before the attacks. The draft report was completed in July, but it has not yet been shared with the individuals named in the document. That step has been delayed for the last 90 days to allow time for Mr. Goss, who took office in September, and his predecessor, John E. McLaughlin, to review the document. In recent weeks, members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have complained to Mr. Goss about the delay. The disclosure of the request from Mr. Goss represents the first indication of how he intends to approach the issue. As the C.I.A.'s inspector general, Mr. Helgerson is an independent internal investigator, subject to presidential appointment and Senate confirmation. According to Congressional and intelligence officials, Mr. Goss wants to limit the report to findings of fact, deferring judgments about who should be held accountable to a separate inquiry by an internal C.I.A. panel known as an Accountability Review Board, which is typically composed of senior agency managers. An intelligence official said that Mr. Goss had requested only that Mr. Helgerson ''consider'' making changes in the ''formatting and presentation'' of the draft report as he believed appropriate. ''Ultimately, it is the call of I.G. to decide how to proceed,'' the intelligence official said. But any recommendation from Mr. Goss would carry significant weight, Congressional and intelligence officials said, because Mr. Helgerson, as an independent internal investigator, reports both to the intelligence chief and to Congress. Congressional officials critical of Mr. Goss's request said they saw it as inconsistent with Congress's intent that the inspector general, not an internal board, determine who, if anyone, should be held responsible for errors related to the Sept. 11 attacks. Among the actions highlighted in previous inquiries by Congress and an independent commission have been the failure of C.I.A. and F.B.I. personnel to share information in summer 2001 that should have put some of the hijackers on a government watch list. Senator Bob Graham of Florida, a Democrat who was co-chairman of the joint Congressional panel on the Sept. 11 attacks, said in an interview that he regarded Mr. Goss's request as ''reasonable'' to protect ''the due process rights of the individuals involved.'' As the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee until this summer, Mr. Goss was the other co-chairman of the joint committee. Representative Jane Harman of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, was also a member of the joint panel. In response to a question about Mr. Goss's new request, Ms. Harman did not comment directly, but issued a statement saying that ''it's past time for Congress to receive this report.'' The convening of an internal board to consider possible disciplinary action represents standard practice for the agency in matters of possible wrongdoing, intelligence officials said. They said such a board was usually convened by the C.I.A.'s executive director, the No. 3 official, customarily after the completion of an inspector general's report. Mr. Helgerson's report is to be made final after he shares his findings with people named in the draft, who will be asked to submit comments, an intelligence official said. But Mr. Helgerson must now decide whether he or the panel of senior C.I.A. officials should draw conclusions about individual responsibility. Mr. Goss informed the leaders of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees about his request in an Oct. 27 letter, according to the Congressional and intelligence officials. He also gave the committees copies of his Oct. 27 memorandum to Mr. Helgerson, the officials said. The officials described both letters as unclassified, but neither the C.I.A. nor the Intelligence Committee leaders would make them public, saying that would violate the panel's rules. The intelligence and Congressional officials who described the documents had all read the letter, and they included both supporters and critics of Mr. Goss's request. In a Sept. 23 letter to Mr. McLaughlin, Ms. Harman and the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said they were ''concerned that the C.I.A. is unwilling to hold its officers accountable for failures to meet the professional standards we know the C.I.A. stands for.'' Last week, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, wrote separately to Mr. Goss, expressing concern ''about the appearance that the inspector general's independence is being infringed.'' Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, did not sign Mr. Rockefeller's letter. But a spokeswoman for Mr. Roberts said last week that ''Senator Roberts has already made it clear to the agency that he expects to see the report upon its completion.''", "title": "C.I.A.

False advertising? A piece of oral history for eBay? Either way, they could soon be the sounds of silence. This summer, Kidd gave the Nets a list of teams he would rather play for. He said he felt the new ownership -- which traded Kenyon Martin and Kerry Kittles in cost-cutting moves -- reneged on promises made before he re-signed with the Nets in the summer of 2003. The reason he re-signed was simple: he wanted to win a championship. Kidd wants out but cannot get out until he has fully rehabilitated his surgically repaired left knee and can prove that he is still the player he was. He is expected to return in early December, then he and his $90 million contract will be on the trading block again. ''In this profession, things aren't stable,'' Kidd said recently. ''They change like the wind.'' Despite Alonzo Mourning's return Thursday after a kidney transplant, despite the Nets' recommitting to Lawrence Frank (the coach Kidd wanted to take Byron Scott's place), and despite Richard Jefferson's signing a six-year deal this summer, Kidd still sounded doubtful. ''That has nothing to do with what happened this summer,'' he said. ''But if they make the team better, that helps. I can only worry about myself at this point. I can't worry about what they're going to do; I have no control over that.'' The Nets' priority is to keep Kidd because they feel there is a solid core behind him and three first-round draft picks, acquired in the Martin deal, for next season. But, according to several officials in the organization, if the Nets can find a quality long-term replacement for him, then they would rebuild the franchise and the fan base without Kidd as they prepare to move to Brooklyn no later than the 2008-9 season. To start this season, Kidd opened training camp with a salvo when he criticized the Nets' moves. When Kidd, 31, came to the Nets in 2001, he was a leader by example, issuing an ambitious promise. He told his disbelieving teammates, who were coming off a 26-victory season, that they would win 40 games. They won 52, and made it to the first of two N.B.A. finals. In three years, Kidd seems to have gone from savior to spoiler, mirroring a pattern that has marked his career. His competitiveness has been a blessing and a bane. He is so consumed by winning that he often complains when the Nets are losing. His unhappiness with a team's direction has, in part, led to his abrupt departures from the University of California, the Dallas Mavericks and the Phoenix Suns. For the first time this summer, Kidd's voice in the organization did not register with ownership, a divided and disorganized lot that was paying attention to the bottom line instead. Kidd gave them something else to look at when he submitted his wish list, topped by Minnesota, Denver, the Lakers, Houston, Sacramento, San Antonio and Dallas. According to three Eastern Conference executives, only one team would gamble on Kidd's knee without seeing him play first -- Minnesota. Minnesota was offering Wally Szczerbiak, Sam Cassell and Latrell Sprewell, in a deal that at one point included the Knicks. The Nets have shown no interest in Szczerbiak, and Cassell's contract, set to expire next year, does not come close to matching Kidd's. San Antonio, where Kidd nearly signed as a free agent in 2003, declined to trade Tony Parker and Manu Gin\u00f3bili. Sacramento did not want to trade Mike Bibby. The Nets were close to sending Kidd back to his original team, Dallas, in a deal for Antoine Walker, but two people involved in the negotiations said the Mavericks' owner, Mark Cuban, wavered after the Nets gave him too much time to think about it. The Mavs, who will start Devin Harris at point guard, will monitor Kidd's recovery. The Nets had a cursory discussion with Portland, but that was not where Kidd wanted to go. Whether teams will be able to absorb his salary will determine if the Nets can trade Kidd and start looking toward the future. ''We're not going to do a deal unless it makes sense,'' the Nets' president, Rod Thorn, said last week. ''Jason has said that he would like to be with a team that he considers to be a championship-type-contender team. But I think he realizes that in order to enhance his value, that he needs to play and show people he can still be Jason Kidd.'' Thorn added: ''I think Jason is going to be here. His rehab is coming along great, and whenever he gets back, he'll be a terrific boost to the team.'' What else can Thorn say? People close to him say that because he had such a close relationship with Kidd, he has been hurt by his demands. On the other hand, Kidd feels he has been misled. Jefferson said: ''Are we going to be able to win an N.B.A. championship with this team? Maybe not this year.'' ''His window is a lot smaller than mine, so I understand his urgency,'' Jefferson added. ''He could have been with Tim Duncan. Certain things were promised to him and they didn't come through.'' In the summer of 2003, when Duncan and the Spurs nearly wooed Kidd away, the Nets honored Kidd's request by signing Mourning, without a physical and without insurance, to a four-year guaranteed deal for $22.6 million. Mourning, battling a kidney ailment, played 12 games before needing a transplant. He returned in the final preseason game on Thursday night and scored 12 points, but Mourning -- like Kidd -- is not happy with the direction of the Nets. When the new Nets owners and the team's investors butted heads in July over whether to keep Martin or cut costs and rebuild, their indecision led to Denver's offer to Martin. In turn, the decision to trade Martin for three draft picks affected the cornerstone of the Nets' investment -- Kidd. ''I don't think that was a consideration at the time,'' Thorn said of the owners' thinking. The consideration is real now, along with the move to trade Kidd.

The police say they should have called an ambulance. Though he did not go to the hospital until later that day, the teenager, Christopher Osbourne, is now at a rehabilitation center in Queens. After spending long hours at his bedside, his mother and stepfather, Carlene Francis and Neville Henry, are facing a year in jail. They were charged in State Supreme Court in the Bronx yesterday -- nearly a month after their son's injury -- with endangering the welfare of a child because they did not take him to the hospital right away. Ms. Francis, 37, and Mr. Henry, 42, would not speak to reporters yesterday when they returned from court, where the judge ordered them released without bail. But neighbors on their quiet residential block in the north Bronx reacted angrily to the criminal charges. Keith Joseph, who said he had been a neighbor of the family for more than a decade, called the accusation ''totally ludicrous and out of order'' and said the police ''did the wrong thing.'' ''We didn't know what was wrong with Chris at the time,'' Mr. Joseph said. ''Nobody did.'' While Mr. Henry, who neighbors said was an auto mechanic, and Ms. Francis, a nurse's aide, were at work that day, Christopher's godmother, Christia Cassis, stopped by the apartment. According to the criminal complaint filed by Robert T. Johnson, the Bronx district attorney, Ms. Cassis saw dried blood on Christopher's body and clothes and two lacerations on his head. She decided his injuries were serious and drove him to Montefiore Medical Center, where he lapsed into a coma for three days. He is in critical condition, the police said yesterday. It is unclear what caused his injury. The couple, who care for two other sons, have no history of child abuse, a spokeswoman for the Administration for Children's Services said yesterday, adding that the agency was now investigating the family. Ms. Francis and Mr. Henry have no previous criminal record, according to their lawyers. ''He was just shocked,'' said Lynn Calvacca, Mr. Henry's lawyer. ''He has no history of any arrests. He's a working man, there are three kids, one that is his and the other two are hers.'' She said that Christopher had been ''very disheveled, very, very, very dirty'' when he returned home that morning, but ''it wasn't something where you would see this person bleeding and obviously in distress.'' She questioned why it had taken the police nearly a month to arrest the couple. A spokesman for Mr. Johnson declined to comment on the timing of the charges. Christopher was taken to the hospital on Oct. 5, the day after he did not return home from a soccer game. His parents said that they assumed he had stayed with an aunt he often visited. But at 7 a.m., an 11-year-old neighbor, Devon Joseph, found him in the vestibule of his building. At that time, Devon and other neighbors said, Christopher was bruised and swollen but conscious and talking. A neighbor took him to his family's door. The police said yesterday that they still did not know exactly what happened to Christopher, who suffered a serious head injury and now does not remember how he got hurt. According to the criminal complaint, Mr. Henry told investigators that when he asked what happened, Christopher, who was covered in grime, said he did not remember. Mr. Henry said he saw blood on Christopher's undershirt. ''After Chris went to the bathroom, he came into the kitchen and laid his head and arms down on the kitchen table,'' Mr. Henry told investigators, according to the criminal complaint. ''I told Chris to go lie down. My wife and I took our other children to school and we went to work.'' The police say that Ms. Francis and Mr. Henry should have known that Christopher needed medical care.

Bayern got a boost last week when striker Claudio Pizarro and midfielder Michael Ballack returned from injury, but the team will be without Lucio, who is serving a one-game suspension. ''Our first goal is to win the German title and then the Champions League,'' Makaay said in a telephone interview late last week before Bayern lost, 2-0, to struggling Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. The defeat left Bayern in fifth place, 4 points behind Wolfsburg. Bayern has won the European title four times and is seeking its fifth Bundesliga title in eight years.

This is one of the biggest teams in the world.'' Makaay left the Netherlands -- where he scored 42 goals in 109 league games for Vitesse Arnhem -- for Spain in 1997. He won the Golden Boot as Europe's leading scorer with Deportivo in 2003 when he scored 29 goals. At a solid 6 feet 1 inch, 178 pounds, Makaay is acrobatic enough to pull balls out of the air and slithery enough to slice through a defense and finish with either foot. ''Every striker must have the confidence to believe he can score, and I've scored everywhere I've played -- Holland, Spain and Germany,'' he said. His move from Deportivo to Bayern (he scored three goals for Deportivo against Bayern in a Champions League match in Munich in October 2002) was a bit of a surprise at home. He was the first Dutch national team player to sign to play in the Bundesliga (there are only eight other Dutch players today in the top flight in Germany). The competition -- some would say animosity -- between the two countries goes back many years, an accident of geography, residue of war and the Dutch disappointment at losing the 1974 World Cup final to host Germany. AMERICANS ABROAD  Chasing a Dream Far From Home Chris Cleary watched in the middle of the night last week as his beloved Red Sox won the World Series. Cleary, 25, was thousands of miles away from his home in Milton, Mass., because he is playing soccer for Worksop Town, about 40 miles from Manchester in north-central England. Cleary played at Boston College, where he was captain in 2002, and in the minor leagues in Germany for Karlsruhe. On Oct. 16, he became the first American to score a hat trick in the English F.A. Cup. He followed that with another goal as Worksop, a semiprofessional team in the Nationwide Conference North, played to a 1-1 tie with Alfreton Town in the final qualifying round for the main draw. A victory in today's replay would give Worksop an $18,000 payday and a home match against Macclesfield Town in the first round. ''This is a steppingstone for me, a chance to get healthy and fit,'' Cleary said in a telephone interview. ''It's not about the money but about playing at the highest level I can. I was making great headway in Germany, scoring bunches of goals, then I hurt my knee.'' Cleary is paid game to game and has the freedom to leave at any time. His team, which is coached by the former Glasgow Celtic player Ronnie Glavin, has had inquires about Clearly from Wrexham, Doncaster, Crewe and Sheffield United. ''You're only young once and this is only a few months in a lifetime, a chance for me to chase my dream,'' Cleary said. ''After scoring the hat trick, I had e-mails from 15 coaches I've never met and guys I played with in high school. It's amazing and great, and hopefully it will help get me where I want to go.'' ARSENAL -- Daniel Karbassiyoon, an 18-year-old striker, scored his first goal for the senior team, the game-winner in the 90th minute, in the Gunners' F.A. Cup victory over Manchester City. Arsenal has sent Frank Simek, a defender, on loan to Queens Park Rangers for a month. GERMANY -- Clint Mathis has not played in the last five games for Hannover. A striker who starred for the MetroStars, Mathis last saw action in the Bundesliga on Sept. 28, leaving a match against Arminia Bielefeld in the 71st minute. Hannover is in third place. M.L.S.  It's Down to the Final Four The four teams that advanced to the Major League Soccer semifinals have one thing in common -- their two-letter initials. D.C., N.E., K.C. and L.A. In the Eastern Conference, D.C. United sent the MetroStars home after the first round for the eighth time in nine years. United will play host to New England on Saturday, but without Ryan Nelsen, its captain and veteran defender, and Dema Kovalenko, the feisty midfielder. They will serve one-game suspensions after getting their second yellow cards of the playoffs. United, the hottest team in the playoffs, has won five straight games and seven of eight, allowing only four goals in those eight games. The Revolution, a team that has scrambled to qualify for the postseason the last three seasons, eliminated Columbus. The Crew entered the playoffs riding an record 18-game unbeaten streak, but New England goalkeeper Matt Reis stopped two poorly taken penalty kicks, and Taylor Twellman scored a goal in the second half as the Revolution won the series, 2-1 on aggregate. In the Western Conference, Kansas City rallied from a two-goal deficit to eliminate San Jose, the defending champion, on Jack Jewsbury's goal in injury time. The Wizards announced yesterday that all tickets for Friday's match at Arrowhead Stadium against Los Angeles will cost $5. Unlike the quarterfinals (home and away, total goals), the semifinals are a single match. If tied after 90 minutes, the teams will play sudden death for a maximum 30 minutes. If still tied, the match will be settled with penalty kicks.

Some 78,000 runners applied for a spot in Sunday's field of 36,000, according to organizers, who say they try to split the race into equal parts international, national and local. The race's popularity has brought an inevitable clash of perspectives. Organizers say they want to accommodate New Yorkers, but they also want the race to reflect the city's diversity and to serve as a postcard for tourism. Meanwhile, some local runners say they feel excluded from a race that courses through the place where they live and train and pay taxes. ''New York is the most diverse, multicultural city in the world,'' said Mary Wittenberg, associate director of the marathon. ''We shouldn't have an event of this magnitude that does anything but reflect the city. Our tag line has been, 'Where the world comes to run.''' The race pumps about $150 million into the local economy; national and international runners stay in the city's hotels, eat in its restaurants and visit Broadway and other attractions, race organizers said. Most of the approximately 12,000 international runners who enter do so through tour-group packages, not through the lottery. These runners pay $110 to $200 for guaranteed entry, organizers said. Members of the New York Road Runners, the club that organizes the race, pay a $70 entry fee, while other American runners pay $80. Some New Yorkers say outsiders are given preferential treatment. Those critics are seeking greater access to the marathon because, they say, it is a local race and their taxes help pay for the thousands of police, fire, emergency and custodial personnel employed on race day. ''This is not a private race,'' Richard Wright, 31, of Manhattan, said in a telephone interview. ''It's like universities, who give preference to people who live in-state. Why? Because they pay taxes.'' Wright said he ran the New York City Marathon last year, gaining a lottery entry after two earlier failures. He has started a Web site -- rrny.org -- and is asking runners to sign an online petition in an attempt to ensure better opportunities for local participants. One who signed the petition is Maxine Joyner, 52, of Manhattan, who works as a volunteer at the marathon. ''I know a lot of New Yorkers who can't get a space; it's sad,'' Joyner said in a telephone interview. ''It's not the New York City Marathon; it's only held here.'' Being a New York City taxpayer doesn't guarantee entry into the marathon any more than it guarantees entry into Yankee Stadium, said Allan Steinfeld, director of the marathon and president of the road runners club. Still, organizers say they are sensitive to the concerns of locals and have implemented several ways to facilitate entry. One, athletes can join the New York Road Runners and run nine club-sponsored races -- from 1 mile to 26.2 miles in a calendar year -- and gain automatic entry into the New York City Marathon the next year. About 4,500 runners have entered the marathon through this method in each of the past two years, Wittenberg, the associate race director, said. Two, runners can gain automatic entry by meeting time standards posted on the club's Web site, nyrrc.org. For instance, a man between 40 and 49 who runs any marathon in three hours or any half-marathon in 1 hour 24 minutes this year gets a guaranteed spot in the 2005 New York City Marathon. Three, any runner who fails to get into the race via the lottery for three consecutive years is guaranteed a spot in the fourth year. Also, runners who cancel before his year's race -- as late as the night before -- are entered next year. Those who have completed 15 or more New York City Marathons are also given automatic entry. ''If you are a committed New Yorker and plan one and a half years in advance, you get in the race,'' Wittenberg said. ''That's not true anywhere else.'' Of the 30,000 entrants from the New York City/New Jersey/Connecticut region, about 17,000 were accepted this year, with expectations that several thousand of them would not show up for the race, organizers said. Some locals believe the time standards are too stringent for many recreational runners. Others say they don't have the time or the money to join New York Road Runners, which charges $35 for a membership and $11 to $22 to run in each of nine club-sponsored races, just for a chance to enter the marathon. Others accuse race officials of profiteering, but organizers note that New York Road Runners is a nonprofit organization. The New York City Marathon accounted for $13.5 million of the running club's $22 million in revenue for 2003, club officials said. Any profit is reinvested to help finance the more than 60 other races the club sponsors yearly, as well as exercise classes, nutrition lectures and walking classes that the club manages as part of its larger mission to promote health and fitness in the city, club officials said. One way to include more local runners in the marathon would be to increase the size of the field to, say, 50,000 entrants. But organizers say this would exacerbate crowding -- at the staging area at Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island, at the start of the race on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and at the finish line in Central Park -- and could lead to jostling of runners at water stations and narrower spots along the course. The lottery system was introduced in the early 1980's, as the field continued to swell annually from the inaugural entry of 127 runners in 1970. The New York Road Runners does not hire an outside auditor to conduct the lottery, but rather uses a computerized system that attempts to fairly select a broad-based field of entrants, organizers said. The Web site started by Wright has provoked vigorous debate. Some who think the system works just fine accuse supposedly sophisticated locals of being parochial whiners.

The data indicated that the amount of additional taxes recommended after audits at the biggest companies would be down more than $8.5 billion in fiscal 2004 from the previous year, a decline of almost 70 percent. Hours spent per audit of the largest corporations, those with assets of $250 million or more, fell by a third, to 783 hours per audit from 1,164. The additional tax recommended per audit fell 69 percent, to $1.1 million, from almost $3.7 million. The data compare audit figures for fiscal 2003 to the annual rate for the first six months of fiscal 2004, the period from Oct. 1, 2003, to March 31, 2004. Leaders of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents most I.R.S. workers, as well as dozens of I.R.S. corporate auditors, have complained about orders to close audits quickly without regard to how much additional tax might be owed. Auditors warned that the practice would cost the government billions of dollars while rewarding tax cheats at the expense of honest taxpayers. In voice-mail messages to the audit staff, the I.R.S. management acknowledged the complaints but insisted that requiring auditors to close cases quickly would not have a negative effect on uncovering tax cheating or on tax revenues. Susan V. Long, an associate professor of management information at Syracuse University and co-director of the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which received the figures from the I.R.S., said the data showed how Congress encouraged tax cheats, and hurt taxpayers, by steadily reducing the resources available for audits. ''This data matters if you care about what corporate America is doing and if you care about whether big companies are made to abide by the same set of laws that us ordinary citizens do,'' Professor Long said. ''This data shows that the length of audit time for the audits of the big guys is really decreasing and that raises questions, clearly, about how thorough audits are and the time pressures the agency is under to produce numbers'' rather than quality law enforcement, she said. A senior I.R.S. spokesman, Terry L. Lemons, said that no one should pay attention to the new data, which he said was ''unreliable because of seasonal factors'' that affect audit rates. Professor Long scoffed at the assertion. She said that for years before the I.R.S. reorganization in 1998, she received quarterly reports of corporate audit activity and found no seasonal variations. ''I have a court order requiring the I.R.S. to give me this data'' every quarter, she said. But in recent years the I.R.S. has provided only annual figures, until Friday when Professor Long said she was given data for the first half of fiscal 2004. Mr. Lemons said that the agency was confident that when data for all of fiscal 2004 came in, it would show a rise in total additional taxes recommended for corporations with more than $10 million of assets. He said audits of corporations with less than $10 million in assets, which are mostly family-owned enterprises, were likely to be down because many auditors had been shifted to pursuing cheating by high-income individuals, especially those secretly using offshore bank accounts. He said that Mark W. Everson, the tax commissioner, was focusing I.R.S. auditors on ''making sure we turn around'' corporate audits more quickly and focus on returns likely to involve cheating. When the data for all of fiscal 2004 are in, Mr. Lemons said, ''audit coverage will be up and the average dollars for large corporations will be up.'' He also predicted that a record amount of money would be brought in through enforcement actions, like audits and collections of past-due taxes. For fiscal 2003, the I.R.S. reported $37 billion collected through enforcement actions, a figure that Mr. Lemons said he was confident would rise by at least 10 percent for fiscal 2004, to more than $40 billion. Over all, the I.R.S. collects about $2 trillion, nearly all of it through voluntary compliance with the tax laws. Correction:  November 3, 2004, Wednesday  An article in Business Day yesterday about the effort by the Internal Revenue Service to speed the completion of audits at big corporations, a step that led to a sharp drop in the discovery of cheating, misstated the value of additional taxes owed by the 11,000 largest companies after the examinations. The overall decline for the 2004 fiscal year, compared with 2003, is expected to be $4.8 billion, not $8.5 billion; the average additional tax per audit is expected to decline by $1.4 million, not $2.5 million.", "title": "I.R.S.

He could certainly use a good laugh after what he endured this year: so depressed that he almost flung himself off a rooftop, he checked into a psychiatric ward and wound up living in homeless shelters. Now jobless and staying at a Bronx residence for military veterans who have hit hard times, Mr. Burkhardt comes home each night to the sight of the man who reminds him to keep smiling. There, taped to the otherwise drab metal door to his room is his own small drawing of a longhaired man letting out a belly laugh. If the man looks vaguely familiar, that's because he is. The smile belongs to Jesus. A dozen years ago, Mr. Burkhardt persuaded an Episcopal priest in a rough-and-tumble South Bronx neighborhood to put a larger version of the drawing on the steeple, as if to dispel the demons of everyday life. Now, after his own journey through mental illness and homelessness, Mr. Burkhardt has a more personal appreciation for the drawing (which he said he originally copied from an illustration in Playboy magazine). Mr. Burkhardt likes to think the laugh came right after Jesus turned water into wine during the wedding feast at Cana. ''I think he just changed the water into wine, when he looks at his chalice and there's nothing in it,'' he said. ''He's laughing and saying 'Hey, guys, fill me up. Don't forget about me.''' Go tell it on the mountain? He could, if he wanted to, since Mr. Burkhardt likes to spend days camping out on five wooded acres that he owns with a dazzling view overlooking the Schoharie Reservoir in upstate New York. For now, however, he is preparing to put a restored drawing of the laughing Jesus at Grace Episcopal Church on City Island, where he is a parishioner. ''Jesus didn't just suffer for us; he laughed, too,'' Mr. Burkhardt said. ''If Jesus returned to the world and went to a church, the first thing he'd see would be himself on the cross. Is that all he wanted to be remembered for?'' His own memories of recent years had slowly, but steadily, nudged him into depression. It started, he said, with his father's death in 1997. It continued through disappointment over an inheritance that never materialized and his being forced to sell some off some properties on City Island to pay back taxes. Mr. Burkhardt, 58, always thought of himself as a regular guy who spent much of his life managing construction projects at high-end stores and the homes of people whose names usually appear in boldface print. He had passed over a job at the World Trade Center that would have started in September 2001. He lost some friends in the terrorist attacks. Other people he knew passed away in the following years. Last April, during a season when most people are thinking of life, he was contemplating death. He could not hold down a job, relations with his former wife were rocky and he faced losing his crash pad at his former brother-in-law's house. During a medical appointment, he told his doctor about the thoughts. Within hours, he said, he was in the veterans' hospital in the Bronx. What could have been the end became a new beginning, as he came to realize he was suffering from depression. One counselor at the hospital showed him how to sign up for benefits that were due to him as an Army veteran. He is just as grateful for the consideration shown by two case workers at the homeless shelter on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, where he lived for a while after being discharged from the hospital. For someone who had hardly ventured to Brooklyn in the good days, living in the shelter was almost surreal. Thefts were rampant, and tempers ran high. He acted tough, even if his words betrayed his attitude. ''There was this little Spanish guy walking around going, 'Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!''' Mr. Burkhardt recalled. ''I said to somebody, 'This guy must miss his girlfriend.' The guy told me, 'No. He's selling loosies, loose cigarettes.' That's how na\u00efve I was.'' But rather than spend his days in day-room limbo, where six radios blared at once, he made sure to make the rounds to get back out on his own: medical appointments, psychiatric sessions, counseling, whatever it took. ''I did what I had to do,'' he said. ''I stood on lines.'' His efforts, several dozen appointments in a few weeks, first paid off with a transfer to a veterans' shelter in Queens, where life was more orderly, if not more hopeful. Another counselor there helped him make his way back to the Bronx, where he moved in midsummer to the New Era Veterans Residence in Soundview. Between the milk crates filled with file folders and the drafting table stuck by the bed, there is hardly space to move inside his new room. Mr. Burkhardt talks about his plans: he wants to organize a tenant group at the residence, where he already has planted a small garden. The files hold several manuscripts he is working on, including one about his dog Lucky (whose name didn't help when a driver ran him over on City Island). Most days, he is trying to show others how to make those small steps toward a normal life. ''Ralph's journey is an interesting one, because he is upfront about his issues, including his mental illness,'' said Jason Ortiz, a senior case manager at the residence. ''Everyone here has gotten into a situation to get here. A lot of them don't fight and just become displaced. Ralph didn't do that. Even when it did not look positive, he kept going. He fought to get out of the shelters.'' He also fought to cling to his little plot upstate, even when he was in the psychiatric ward and in shelters. Longing for what he thought was the view's therapeutic power, he cadged overnight passes and roughed it under the stars. The key word is rough: his patch is at the end of a rutted gravel road, where a tent is pitched under a series of sail-like tarps he has rigged to trees. Logs tossed in a flaming pile serve as radiator and stove. A bucket is his bathroom. But the view -- as sure a sign of the divine as any -- is worth it. ''This is my piece of heaven,'' he said. ''I thought of putting the laughing Jesus here, but nobody would see it. My closest neighbor is two and a half miles away. You start hearing buzzing in your ears here, it is so quiet.'' Instead, he'll bring it to City Island, where the new pastor of Grace Episcopal Church is already intrigued. ''This is a parish desperately trying to come back from being nearly closed,'' said the Rev. Patricia Alexander, who arrived at Grace six weeks ago. ''Anything we can do to draw people is exciting.'' A few days ago at the veterans' residence, Mr. Burkhardt was finishing up retouching the picture. He left it in the hallway while he ran a quick errand. Another man walked by and looked at it, puzzled. ''A laughing Jesus?'' the man said. ''I don't know about that.'' That's O.K. Ralph Burkhardt does, and then some.

One Iraqi guard and one attacker were killed, officials said. Besides the American, those taken hostage were a Nepali and two Arabs from outside Iraq. ''They stormed the villa with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades,'' one police official told Reuters. ''They had no chance.'' News agencies reported that the four captives worked for the Saudi Arabian Trading and Contracting Company, a Riyadh-based company owned by Saudi and Lebanese businessmen that supplies American forces in Iraq, though there was no immediate confirmation of that. The American was not identified, and by early Tuesday no one had claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. Earlier on Monday, gunmen ambushed and killed the deputy governor of Baghdad Province, Hatim Kamil, as he drove to work. Two of Mr. Kamil's bodyguards were wounded, the police said. Insurgents have stepped up a campaign of assassinations against Iraqi government officials, a tactic that is draining the country of its skilled bureaucrats and has American military officials increasingly worried. In the provincial capital, Ramadi, a freelance cameraman working for Reuters was killed, apparently by a sniper, possibly an American marine. The violence across Iraq unfolded as negotiations continued over a peace agreement to avert a planned American invasion of Falluja, the insurgent stronghold 35 miles west of the capital. In an interview with a Kuwaiti newspaper, the Iraqi president, Sheik Ghazi al-Yawar, said talks must continue, and that insurgents ''want nothing but a military solution and the continuation of bleeding for Iraqis.'' His comments were a sharp contrast to those of Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, who on Sunday warned that time was running out for a peaceful solution and that he was quite willing to order an invasion. ''I completely disagree with those who see a need to decide the matter through military action,'' the president told the daily Al Qabas. ''The coalition's handling of this crisis is wrong. It's like someone who shoots at his horse's head just because a fly has landed on it. The fly escapes and the horse is dead.'' Early Tuesday, the American military said it had conducted an airstrike around midnight in Falluja that had destroyed a weapons cache. The Marines have been carrying out airstrikes on the city almost daily and have been amassing forces in the area to prepare for an attempt to sweep through both Falluja and Ramadi, 30 miles farther west. Military commanders say they believe thousands of insurgents are building up fortifications in Falluja. With Iraq's first general elections scheduled for January, American and Iraqi officials say major rebel cities must be brought under government control to ensure wide voter turnout and legitimate results. About 4,000 new American troops began arriving in Iraq on Monday to reinforce the 138,000 troops already here in advance of the elections. Voter and party registration began on Monday across Iraq. Adel al-Lami, a supervisor at the Iraqi electoral commission, said a ''very limited'' number of parties showed up in Baghdad's fortified Green Zone to register because it was only the first day. The deadline is the end of the month. Voter registration seemed somewhat problematic. An estimated 14 million Iraqis are eligible to vote, and registration lists are supposed to be presented to the heads of households at centers where Iraqis go to collect their monthly food rations. But an Iraqi reporter who went to 10 of those centers in Baghdad found no lists being given out, although people were walking out of the centers with rice, sugar, milk and other foodstuffs. At four of the food distribution centers, in the Sunni-dominated Adhamiya neighborhood of Baghdad, Iraqis received notices informing them of the importance of taking part in the elections. Asked about the absence of registration lists, Mr. Lami said he was surprised. ''I'll check on it,'' he said. ''As far as I know, they should be distributed with the food rations today.'' In Ramadi, the capital of Anbar Province, a cameraman, Dhia Najim, was killed while covering fighting, Reuters reported. He was a freelancer from Ramadi and had worked for The Associated Press and Reuters, among other news agencies. His death was under investigation. The Committee to Protect Journalists, based in New York, estimated that 36 journalists had been killed in the war, including 19 dying from insurgent actions and at least 8 from American fire. Also in Ramadi, insurgents attacked Army military vehicle patrols in town, a spokesman for the Second Brigade Combat Team said at Camp Ramadi. Late in the afternoon, insurgents launched what appeared to be 8 to 10 mortars or rockets into the base, wounding two servicemen. The projectile that caused the injuries left a two-foot-deep crater near one of the base's more heavily traveled roads. The Baghdad neighborhood where the kidnappings of the four foreigners took place, Mansour, a suburb of elegant homes west of the Tigris River, has recently experienced a spike in violence. On Sunday, insurgents detonated a car bomb right outside the offices there of Al Arabiya, a popular Arab television news network based in Dubai. The explosion collapsed part of the building and killed at least 7 people, 5 of them network employees, and wounded 19. In September, a band of kidnappers staged a dawn raid on a house and office in Mansour used by two American engineers and a Briton. The men were taken as two of them walked outside their compound to start up a power generator, witnesses said. Later, all three men appeared in a video made by the militant group led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. When the American-led forces refused to meet the demands of Mr. Zarqawi, his group beheaded the two Americans, Eugene Armstrong and Jack Hensley, and later the Briton, Kenneth Bigley. Mansour is home to many Iraqi officials, as well as Ahmad Chalabi, the former political exile once favored by the Pentagon, and Adnan Pachachi, a prominent member of the former Iraqi Governing Council who plans to contest the January elections. More than 160 foreigners have been kidnapped in the country since April, when a two-front uprising exploded in Iraq. Most have been released after the captives' countries or companies agreed to make payments. Dozens have been killed, including three Americans.

In another of a series of relatively small steps involving cancer treatment, the agency, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, proposed paying for a variety of colon cancer drugs when those medications are used in any of nine clinical trials that will test their effectiveness against other cancers. The announcement on Monday provided a further glimpse into changes in Medicare's operation that would be likely to continue if President Bush were re-elected. The most significant of the new steps involves spending $300 million on the nationwide demonstration program next year to gauge how patients feel during treatment. In return for $130 a patient per day, oncologists will collect information about three conditions: pain; nausea and vomiting; and fatigue. The project grew out of a sharp dispute between Medicare officials and cancer doctors over reimbursement. The Medicare legislation enacted last year made significant changes in the way those doctors are paid, a modification that threatened to cut their incomes substantially. The doctors argued that the program was not paying them enough for the many things they did to enhance patients' quality of life. In announcing the $300 million project on Monday, Dr. Mark B. McClellan, the agency's administrator, offered the kind of split-the-difference approach that he has been making a hallmark of his tenure: the oncologists will get much of the money they have demanded for care they give to improve patients' quality of life, but only if they collect data about how well their efforts are working. And the test will last only one year. ''This is really about developing better evidence,'' Dr. McClellan said. ''We're not just giving doctors more money.'' Dr. Joseph Bailes, co-chairman of the government relations committee for the American Society of Clinical Oncology, said the project was ''an important recognition that the resources have to be there to care for individuals with cancer.'' For decades, Medicare has chosen either to pay for a therapy or not to pay, to pay doctors more or not, with little in between. And once the agency decided to pay for drugs, physicians could largely use them how they wished. But Dr. McClellan is increasingly agreeing to pay for unproven treatments only for those who agree to participate in clinical trials. So it was Monday, when he announced that Medicare had joined with the National Cancer Institute to finance the nine trials of approved cancer drugs for unapproved uses. The trials, laid out in a proposal that will now be subject to a period of public comment before final adoption, will involve 2,000 to 3,000 patients, a tiny fraction of the roughly 40 million people in the Medicare program. Even for these patients, Medicare's decision will most likely have little effect, since most cancer patients who participate in clinical trials sponsored by the cancer institute have their care paid for as a condition of joining the trial. But Medicare's involvement will speed the trials, Dr. McClellan said. ''Our goal is to get to the answer faster,'' he said, ''as to whether or not these treatments are beneficial or not.'' The drugs at issue are Erbitux, from ImClone Systems; Avastin, from Genentech; Camptosar, from Pfizer; and Eloxatin, from Sanofi-Synthelabo. In addition, the agency said, Medicare will now pay for positron emission tomography, or PET scans, for cervical cancer and for studies of the scans' uses in other cancers.", "title": "Medicare Takes Steps Broadening Coverage of Cancer Care"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/U.S.", "Top/News", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Medicare", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Cancer", "Top/News/Health", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Healthcare", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Doctors", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Medicine and Health", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology and Science", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Colon Cancer", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Chemotherapy"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Health; U.S.", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "National Desk", "print_page_number": "18", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/politics/02drug.html", "print_column": "3", "slug": "02DRUG$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Oracle raised its offer for PeopleSoft on Monday from $21 a share to $24 a share. The higher bid, which values PeopleSoft at $9.2 billion, comes less than a month after Oracle executives said in Delaware Chancery Court that the company was leaning toward lowering its offer. The latest offer, Oracle's fifth since it first announced its hostile takeover bid for PeopleSoft in June 2003, comes just a week after the European Commission said it would not block the merger, removing the last regulatory hurdle to the deal. Both companies make software that large corporations use to manage their operations and handle tasks like accounting and human resources management. Jeff Henley, Oracle's chairman, called the new price per share to be Oracle's ''best and final offer,'' and urged PeopleSoft shareholders to act quickly. The company said that it would withdraw the offer if a majority of PeopleSoft shares were not tendered by Nov. 19. ''We think the time has come for the stockholders of PeopleSoft to decide the outcome,'' Mr. Henley said during a conference call with analysts early Monday. It was unclear on Monday how Oracle arrived at the latest price. But its executives told analysts that the company decided to raise its offer after the judge in the Delaware case, Vice Chancellor Leo E. Strine Jr., asked Oracle to put out its best offer before he made a ruling in the case. Oracle had sued PeopleSoft in Delaware to force it to remove its poison pill provision, which would make a hostile acquisition prohibitively expensive. The provision would release a flood of additional shares to the market and make it nearly impossible for an acquirer to gain a controlling stake in the company. Mr. Henley said the $24-a-share offer was 60 percent higher than PeopleSoft's closing price the day before Oracle's initial offer in June 2003, and is ''substantially higher than what PeopleSoft would be trading at if it weren't for the Oracle offer.'' Oracle executives also said that even at $24 a share, the merger would add to Oracle's earnings per share within 12 months, excluding some expenses. The news caused PeopleSoft shares to gain $2.16, to close at $22.93. In response to the higher bid, PeopleSoft's board advised shareholders to ''take no action at this time,'' and said it would meet to review the offer and make a recommendation, but gave no indication of the timing. The board's statement noted that in February it rejected Oracle's offer of $26 a share, the highest bid offered. Oracle reduced that to $21 a share in May after a decline in the share price. PeopleSoft, based in Pleasanton, Calif., has continually contended that the hostile merger is bad for its customers. But in Monday's announcement, Oracle appeared to be trying to appease PeopleSoft customers by stating that it planned to release an upgrade to PeopleSoft's software, though there was no indication that Oracle would sustain two product lines for the long term. Previously, Oracle, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., said it would provide support for PeopleSoft products for a decade but would not expand or further develop PeopleSoft's product line. At the trial last month, Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle's chief executive, and Safra A. Catz, Oracle's co-president, both told the Delaware court that the company was leaning toward lowering its offer rather than raising it because PeopleSoft's business was suffering. But many analysts viewed the courtroom statements by Oracle executives as an effort to pressure PeopleSoft shareholders. David Hilal, an analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey, called the courtroom comments by the Oracle leaders ''posturing.'' Mr. Hilal said he believed all along that Oracle would be willing to pay more than $21 a share for PeopleSoft because it wanted the merger. Now at $24 a share, he said, there is no reason for PeopleSoft shareholders not to tender their shares. ''If you were a PeopleSoft shareholder, why wouldn't you tender?'' Mr. Hilal said, since the new price offers a premium over the company's value. Others disagreed. Tad Piper, an analyst with Piper Jaffray & Company, said he did not think that the PeopleSoft board was ready to accept the latest offer, nor was Oracle's latest offer necessarily its last. ''I don't think we've read the final chapter in this soap opera,'' Mr. Piper said. ''I'm not convinced the board is going to come out in support of this offer, after they rejected $26.'' Even though PeopleSoft has not performed well this year, he said, it still has a business that could add to Oracle's earnings per share. PeopleSoft countered on Monday that discussions between the companies and the judge were confidential, and that it was inappropriate for Oracle to comment publicly on them. PeopleSoft called Oracle's comments Monday inaccurate but would not elaborate. ''In light of Oracle having chosen to characterize this off-the-record conference, we feel compelled to simply note that we believe that Oracle's comment does not accurately reflect what occurred,'' PeopleSoft said Monday. Oracle executives said they would ask Vice Chancellor Strine to take action if a majority of PeopleSoft shareholders tendered shares by Nov. 19 and PeopleSoft did not rescind its poison pill. The company has also asked the judge to force PeopleSoft to cancel its customer assurance plan, which could create a $2 billion liability for Oracle after a merger. During the Delaware trial, PeopleSoft directors told the court that they would consider an Oracle offer for PeopleSoft if the price was raised and certain conditions were met. On Oct. 5, the second day of the trial, Steven D. Goldby, a PeopleSoft director, testified that a deal would be possible under certain conditions.

That huge increase is already stirring worries that venture capitalists will soon be rushing to finance start-ups with dubious business prospects simply because the money is there. The data, released on Monday by the National Venture Capital Association and Thomson Venture Economics, drew a mixed reaction from the association's president, Mark G. Heesen. While Mr. Heesen praised venture investing as consistently providing strong returns, he warned venture capitalists to avoid the temptation of raising ever-larger funds in the coming months. ''If the industry begins to take more money than can be invested successfully, performance will suffer,'' Mr. Heesen said. Steven Dow, a venture capitalist with Sevin Rosen in Palo Alto, Calif., was not so circumspect. ''I think it's horrible news,'' Mr. Dow said of the increase in dollars raised. ''I think it's going to be very hard for the industry as a whole to make good returns when the committed capital in a given year exceeds $10 billion to $12 billion. And we're on a pace roughly double that.'' Mr. Dow's own firm raised a new $300 million fund in July. ''I think at the macro level it's obvious to everyone that there's too much money in this asset class,'' Mr. Dow said. ''But at the micro level of course every firm thinks it's different.'' The growth in venture fund-raising came as no surprise to Catherine A. Crockett, a managing director at Grove Street Advisors, a firm in Wellesley, Mass., that invests in venture capital funds on behalf of wealthy clients. ''Fund-raising in venture has been way off for the last several years, which is a good thing,'' Ms. Crockett said. ''So everyone was expecting that there was going to be some uptick taking place around now.'' ''I think if we continue to see these high numbers, that would be a trend that concerned me,'' she added. Steven P. Bird, a partner at Focus Ventures in Palo Alto, also expected a bump in venture fund-raising given that the venture industry raised only $3.66 billion in 2002, according to Thomson Venture Economics and the National Venture Capital Association, and $10.53 billion in 2003. That follows $38.06 billion raised in 2001, and $106.03 billion raised in 2000 -- sums so large that venture firms collectively still have tens of billions of extra cash on hand. ''The industry was investing a lot more than it had been raising for two and a half years,'' Mr. Bird said. Now the opposite is starting to happen. The news dominating the venture industry last week was a pair of reports showing that investments in start-ups had fallen sharply in the third quarter. Thomson Venture Economics and the venture capitalists' association, along with PricewaterhouseCoopers, reported that venture capitalists invested $4.3 billion in the third quarter, which means the industry raised $1.2 billion more than it spent in the quarter. ''We shouldn't get too carried away based on one quarter's numbers,'' Mr. Bird said. ''But if you call back in a few quarters and tell me fund-raising's up another 78 percent, then we'll have a real problem.''

DETROIT PISTONS -- The defending champion Pistons changed little in the off-season, which is why they should conquer the East again. With the core of supposed nonsuperstars returning to Coach Larry Brown's system (losing only Corliss Williamson and Mehmet Okur), Detroit added an X-factor in the refurbished forward Antonio McDyess. If McDyess can return to his explosive form of four years ago, the Pistons' frontcourt, led by the Wallaces, Ben and Rasheed, should be indomitable. Guards Richard Hamilton and Chauncey Billups, the most valuable player of the finals, are becoming household names. Fame and the San Antonio Spurs are the only things that could foil a Pistons repeat. PLAYOFF BOUND 2. INDIANA PACERS -- The Pacers won a league-best 61 games last season, but now the roster reads like a list of doctors' rounds. Reggie Miller's broken hand will keep him out for the first two months of the season. Jermaine O'Neal's left foot will keep him out at least five games, and then there is Jeff Foster (hip surgery), Anthony Johnson (broken hand), and Jonathan Bender (left knee). The key off-season pickup, Stephen Jackson, dazzles offensively when he focuses and Ron Artest dazzles defensively when he focuses, but Indiana's instability is at point guard. 3. MIAMI HEAT -- Shaquille O'Neal remains the league's most dominant player, more so now that he is about 35 pounds lighter. Now Dwyane Wade is his respectful wingman, and Pat Riley is betting the full house on the fact that neither gets injured. The veteran Eddie Jones could be the glue. Riley acquired a collection of shooters -- Damon Jones, Keyon Dooling, Wesley Person -- to supplement the young forwards Rasual Butler and Udonis Haslem. 4. PHILADELPHIA 76ERS -- Allen Iverson has a new coach in Jim O'Brien, who, for now, loves his guard as much as he loves being back in his hometown. The veterans Aaron McKie and Marc Jackson bolster the starting lineup. The Sixers say they are trying to trade Glenn Robinson. The second-year center Samuel Dalembert will fight for his starting job and may be a year away. Corliss Williamson adds toughness. Iverson will still call, and take, the shots. If more than a third go in, the Sixers could beat out the Knicks to win the Atlantic Division. 5. CLEVELAND CAVALIERS -- Every winner needs a 1-2 punch, and the Cavaliers have it in the superstar LeBron James and center Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the only true center in the East after O'Neal. The Cavs acquired point guard Eric Snow, who ran the show in Philadelphia. His presence should help soften the blow of the inexcusable loss of Carlos Boozer. The Cavs' fortunes follow the arc of James's shot. 6. ORLANDO MAGIC -- The Magic could be the surprise team in the East. Steve Francis is again the focal point. The No. 1 pick Dwight Howard could be the rookie of the year, and Grant Hill could be the comeback player of the year. Look for Hedo Turkoglu and the rookie Jameer Nelson off the bench. 7. KNICKS -- After a blip of a playoff run, a new season brings old problems --  Allan Houston's left knee, the lack of a low-post presence. There is hope, as Jamal Crawford brings scoring excitement to the Garden. Wait, isn't that what Stephon Marbury was supposed to do? Suspect defense and a losing streak could unleash some bad attitudes (Coach Lenny Wilkens, beware) as Isiah Thomas keeps trying to find the long, athletic players that work in his system. PLAYOFF BUBBLE 8. BOSTON CELTICS -- Doc Rivers will live off the Beantown karma in his first  season back on the sideline. The Celtics are anchored by the Boston stalwart Paul Pierce and boosted by Gary Payton and forward Raef LaFrentz, back from injury. This team could fall apart as easily as it could surprise, and General Manager Danny Ainge is under the gun. 9. NETS -- Jason Kidd wants out, and the team's fortunes ultimately hinge on which franchise will be willing to take on his contract and make the right deal in return. He is working to get back on the court quickly after knee surgery. Richard Jefferson is the de facto franchise player, and Eric Williams and Ron Mercer were solid pickups. LOTTERY LAND 10. MILWAUKEE BUCKS -- There is still no timetable for T.J. Ford to return from his surgery in May to repair a spinal cord bruise, and this team will suffer, despite the coaching of Terry Porter. Keith Van Horn, Toni Kukoc and Joe Smith make an odd offensive threesome. Mike James (from the Pistons) was the biggest off-season acquisition. 11. CHICAGO BULLS -- The Bulls are rebuilding for the sixth straight season. It is past time for the youngsters Eddy Curry and Tyson Chandler to grow up, although Chicago got younger with the rookies Luol Deng and Ben Gordon. Andres Nocioni, the gold medalist from Argentina, could be the breakout international player of the year. 12. WASHINGTON WIZARDS -- The Wizards had a key off-season pickup in Antawn Jamison, who rejoined his former Golden State mates Gilbert Arenas and Larry Hughes to see if the partnership works better than it did in the West. Jarvis Hayes is intriguing. 13. TORONTO RAPTORS -- Just when there is no ''Hockey Night in Canada,'' Vince Carter wants out of Toronto. Jalen Rose is reliable, and the second-year center Chris Bosh is quickly improving. The new coach, Sam Mitchell, has no easy task. 14. ATLANTA HAWKS -- Antoine Walker and Al Harrington joined the Hawks in a trade, and Kenny Anderson is back in his college town. The club is under new ownership and new sideline direction but still under construction. 15. CHARLOTTE BOBCATS -- A collection of has-beens, wanna-bees and aboutto-bees starts from the ground up and will not get very far in this first year back in the Queen City. Western Conference TITLE CONTENDERS 1. SAN ANTONIO SPURS -- The Spurs are so well constructed that their best off-season pickup, the shooting guard Brent Barry, comes off the bench. Throw his preseason bricks out the window. Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili surround Tim Duncan, the game's most complete player, who is so thankful to be playing with three N.B.A. referees that he hopes to erase whatever bad feelings remain from the Olympics. This is the team that can best take advantage of Shaquille O'Neal's departure from the West. Look for Coach Gregg Popovich to meet his friend Larry Brown, whom he summered with, in the finals. And win. 2. MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES -- Kevin Garnett, the reigning most valuable player, will again contend with O'Neal for the honor as his game continues to soar. The Timberwolves were closer than ever last season, and with a healthy Sam Cassell and solid depth (Fred Hoiberg, Ervin Johnson), they could vie for the conference title. But with Cassell and Latrell Sprewell griping over contracts, the roster is unsettled. Do not expect it to remain the same. Minnesota has its eye on Jason Kidd, a scary thought. PLAYOFF BOUND 3. HOUSTON ROCKETS -- Do not anoint Yao Ming yet. Ming, the 7-foot-6 center from China, is in only his third season and still must overcome some defensive weaknesses before he can be the dominating center of the West. But now he has a wingman in Tracy McGrady to make this the new top inside-outside combo in the league. Will McGrady give in to the concept of giving Ming the ball? Charlie Ward is back running the point under his old coach, Jeff van Gundy, and his job is simple -- make sure Yao gets the ball. Jim Jackson provides a key shooting presence. 4. DENVER NUGGETS -- The Nuggets will not be boring. They will be running, flying and high-fiving in the high altitude. As long as Carmelo Anthony stays grounded in his second season, the Nuggets will be a legitimate force. Kenyon Martin got his huge deal and said he had no problem sharing the ball with Anthony and Andre Miller. Marcus Camby got his deal, too, making the Nuggets solid almost everywhere. 5. LOS ANGELES LAKERS -- Kobe Bryant got what he wanted. His team. All the shots he's fit to take. Coach Rudy Tomjanovich is back on the sideline to make sense of the aftermath of the Lakers' implosion. It may not be pretty. Vlade Divac is injured, aging, but not quite finished. Chucky Atkins was a downgrade from Derek Fisher and Gary Payton. Forward Lamar Odom, a complete player with a selfless attitude, was a nice consolation in the trade for O'Neal. But he will be no replacement for the real thing, as Bryant will realize by the time he sees his old friend at the All-Star Game break. 6. SACRAMENTO KINGS -- Cracks developed along the fault line this summer, with Peja Stojakovic expressing his desire to be traded and Chris Webber continuing to whine. The Kings did not give Coach Rick Adelman an extension, a telling sign to produce or pack. Still, with Mike Bibby at the point, Doug Christie shooting reliably and Brad Miller at center (with Greg Ostertag his backup), the Kings have enough to stay in the upper echelon but not enough to break through. 7. MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES -- Pau Gasol, whose stock rose after his Olympics with Spain, leads a young, athletic team. Jason Williams jelled with Coach Hubie Brown last season, and Mike Miller and Bonzi Wells provided shooting spark. The Grizzlies picked up Brian Cardinal, whose toughness will no longer be a surprise. 8. DALLAS MAVERICKS -- The Mavericks are on the edge. After losing the free agent Steve Nash to the Suns, the Mavs got Jason Terry, more a twoguard than a point guard. Dirk Nowitzki, the top international player in the league, has to get over his best friend's departure, though he will feel better with center Erick Dampier's tough presence. Marquis Daniels has to avoid a sophomore slump. There are too many question marks, including whether Coach Don Nelson will last the year. PLAYOFF BUBBLE 9. PHOENIX SUNS -- Steve Nash is back, and his leadership could help push the improved Suns into a playoff spot. Shawn Marion was on the trading block this summer, but his and Amare Stoudemire's athleticism should complement Nash's play. Quentin Richardson provides more offense. 10. UTAH JAZZ -- Power forward Carlos Boozer left Lake Erie for Salt Lake and now must justify his contract. Mehmet Okur, another key off-season pickup, is inconsistent. Andrei Kirilenko, one of the most versatile players in the league, signed a maximum contract, and the team was bolstered by Matt Harpring's return. LOTTERY LAND 11. PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS -- Theo Ratliff is a top-notch defender, and Zach Randolph could be the cornerstone of a team that seems to be forever changing. It is only a matter of time before Sebastian Telfair breaks out at point guard. How much time is left for Coach Maurice Cheeks? 12. GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS -- Intriguing youth with Troy Murphy, Jason Richardson and Mike Dunleavy. Speedy Claxton and Derek Fisher anchor the point-guard spot. But this team is still undermanned in the West. 13. NEW ORLEANS HORNETS -- The stars Baron Davis and Jamaal Magloire want out. The fans don't want in. Coach Byron Scott is back, and he gets to go West. Not so easy there. 14. SEATTLE SUPERSONICS -- Ray Allen's feud with Kobe Bryant was the best thing that happened to the SuperSonics, because it overshadowed the glaring holes on the roster. Danny Fortson and Vitaly Potapenko, out six weeks with a broken hand, typify a team that is going nowhere. 15. LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS -- Poor Elton Brand, perhaps it is the Duke curse. The Nets stalwart Kerry Kittles was traded for nothing, though he is recovering from another knee operation.

A strong Senate bill, which would give Haiti preferential access to the United States clothing and textile market, passed unanimously this summer. Clothing manufacturers, including J.C. Penney, then told members of the House Ways and Means Committee that the measure would allow them to build factories across Haiti that would employ thousands of workers making T-shirts and sweatshirts.

Having effectively watered the bill down, Ways and Means Committee members headed out of town to campaign for re-election. With much left on their plate for the upcoming lame-duck session, chances are dim for fixing this measure. Bush administration officials said back in February that this time around, they would do the right thing in a country where per capita income barely hits $300, the unemployment rate is 80 percent and people actually make food out of mud. But the administration has remained quiet on the Haiti trade bill. Meanwhile, with rampant corruption and endemic poverty crippling Haiti, most of the country's few textile factories have shut down. American troops are long gone, and an anemic United Nations force has done little to restore hope. Haiti's apparel industry, which employed some 60,000 people in the 1980's, has shrunk to 20,000 jobs. A few lawmakers, including Representative Charles Rangel, indicate that they may try to revive the bill in the lame-duck session. We hope they do and that their colleagues do the right thing.

But nothing is simple in the post-2000 political world. We all know the difference between a swing state and one that's long been consigned to the column of sure things. If you happen to be living in Ohio or Florida, nobody has to explain why it is important for you to go to the polls today. But citizenship is more complicated in places like New York and California, or Utah and Georgia, where electoral votes were all but conceded by last spring. Still, every vote counts. Including the ones that already feel counted. On the presidential level, the popular vote really does matter, despite the Electoral College. Those of us in the deep-dyed blue or red states vote to register our bit of the national will, to help confer a mandate on our chosen candidate or withhold one should the other side triumph. We vote because the very act of turning out shows that we believe that this election is critically important, and we don't want to give even the slightest impression that it doesn't matter to us who wins. We vote because the rest of the world has become disillusioned enough about the American political process. If people can ride donkeys over mountains in Afghanistan to choose among the decidedly imperfect candidates they were offered last month in their first democratic election, we can stand in line and force election officials to make sure our vote is recorded. And if people can find the location of their voting place in Kandahar, we can call up the board of elections or go on the Web to make sure we're heading for the right site here. And once we find the right polling place, we're going to vote to make sure that our election officials are doing their job properly and to reassure the shocking numbers of our fellow Americans, especially first-time voters or minorities, who believe they will be prevented from casting a ballot or that it will not be counted. Here in New York, for instance, we have seen plenty of evidence that it is only the wide margins in most races that have been saving the state's creaky voting system from a meltdown that would make Florida look like Athens in the age of Pericles. If we start complaining now, perhaps we can fix things before it's too late. We're going to vote because in many places there are other matters -- ballot propositions, state legislative races, Congressional contests -- that deserve our attention. And even if all of those contests seem like foregone conclusions as well, we can vote to send a message. An incumbent state legislator who is used to getting 70 percent of the vote every year will feel a thrill of terror if this season's opponent comes within 10 percent, and may well be inspired to try to improve the political status quo that's causing dissatisfaction. Most of all, we're going to vote because this is our country, our election, our national future. It's not possible to make up enough rules or roadblocks to discourage us.

Rehnquist that he would not return to the bench on Monday indicated that his thyroid cancer was more advanced and aggressive than he disclosed a week ago. In a statement issued minutes before he was due to lead the court in hearing oral arguments today, Chief Justice Rehnquist, 80, said the plan to return to work that he announced Oct. 25, when he disclosed his illness, ''was too optimistic.'' The chief justice omitted any reference to when, or if, he would return to the bench or his office, and said he would work from home while continuing to receive radiation and chemotherapy as an outpatient. Radiation and chemotherapy are usually reserved for advanced and aggressive forms of thyroid cancer and are rarely intended to achieve a cure, experts not connected with the chief justice's case said in interviews. The main intent is to temporarily put brakes on the spread of the cancer and to extend the lives of patients for a number of months, said Dr. Lewis E. Braverman, who is chief of endocrinology at Boston University and editor of a leading textbook on the thyroid gland. Because Chief Justice Rehnquist has not released the most crucial information about his illness -- the specific type of thyroid cancer and the extent of its spread -- any assessment must rely on speculation, the experts emphasized. But they said the chief justice had provided important medical clues to the seriousness of his case in disclosing the need for radiation and chemotherapy in addition to his tracheotomy last month. In addition, they noted that he had omitted any mention of the usual treatment for thyroid cancer: surgical removal of the thyroid gland. The new information ''firmed up a little more that he has one of the bad types like anaplastic thyroid cancer,'' said Dr. Leonard Wartofsky of the Washington Hospital Center. Anaplastic thyroid cancer is rare, one of the most aggressive human cancers, and when it occurs it is mostly in older people. Anaplastic cancers often arise among people with a long history of an enlarged thyroid gland that also contained nodules, or bumps, that a doctor can feel with the fingers. Radiation is a common therapy for anaplastic thyroid cancer. But the addition of chemotherapy does not rule out any other kind of thyroid cancer because the two forms of treatment can be combined, depending on circumstances in each case. Experts said, however, that they could not rule out the possibility that Chief Justice Rehnquist had less aggressive, but still serious, forms of thyroid cancer like medullary and follicular, or even a lymphoma that arises in the thyroid. The prognosis also varies according to the growth characteristics of each patient's cancer and its response to treatment. In a best case situation, they said, Chief Justice Rehnquist could survive for months, even more than a year. But on the sketchy information available, ''it looks pretty grim,'' said Dr. James A. Fagin, director of the division of endocrinology at the University of Cincinnati. ''The choice of using chemotherapy and radiotherapy is already talking about heroic approaches because neither of these is believed to be very helpful in general for any type of thyroid cancer,'' Dr. Fagin said. The median survival for anaplastic thyroid cancer is two to six months, but with newer treatments ''a small fraction of patients have survived more than 12 months,'' Dr. Fagin said. The experts said thyroid cancer patients should not assume that they were receiving inferior care if their therapy was not the same as the chief justice's. Chief Justice Rehnquist's care ''is far from what most patients with thyroid cancer would require,'' said Dr. Steven I. Sherman, chairman of the department of endocrinologic cancer at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Patients with the usual, less aggressive kind of thyroid cancer usually receive radioactive iodine to destroy the thyroid. But the kind of radiation Chief Justice Rehnquist is undergoing -- external beam radiation -- is different and more powerful. The course of such radiation is often four to six weeks but could be as short as three weeks, the experts said. Patients can receive therapy in the morning and go back to work the rest of the day, although patients often complain of fatigue. The experts said that the prognosis for patients with advanced thyroid cancer depended on many factors like an individual's personality and what other ailments they might have. They said that they assumed the chief justice would have released more information if he had a good prognosis. The experts said their bleak prognosis was based on information collected from many cases and studies.

I know I'm not the only conservative to think this way. I look at my favorite conservative bloggers and see many coming out for John Kerry. I talk to my friends at conservative think tanks and magazines and notice that they are deeply ambivalent about the administration, even those who would never vote for a Democrat. Like all these folks, I look at the Bush administration with a mixture of admiration, frustration and anger. I'm frustrated that Bush didn't build the governing majority that was there for the taking. He came to power with good ideas on how to move the G.O.P. beyond the Gingrich stall. But time and again, he abandoned his reformist strategy to give spoils to the G.O.P. donor base. To take one small example: on environmental policy, he showed interest in moving to a flexible, market-based system that would have cleaned the environment better than the current system. But too often rules were written to please key industries. Voters who could have been turned on by new, effective approaches were instead appalled at unseemly self-dealing. I'm exasperated at the Bush communications strategy. His advisers came in with one rule: no concessions to elite opinion. They decided not to be open on how they make decisions. They would never admit mistakes. They would not fully engage with Washington or even with Republicans on Capitol Hill. In so doing, they pushed away many who could have helped them -- most important, pro-war Democrats. They fed the misconception that this is an administration that does not deliberate. They further polarized the political climate, in ways that only make it more difficult to get anything done. I'm angry at the decision not to send enough troops into Iraq. The history of the 1990's suggested that when societies are transformed, establishing law and order is the most important thing. Yet that lesson was ignored. People from the center to the right were screaming for more boots on the ground, but the administration never performed the elementary task of statecraft: matching the tools at your disposal to the goals you hope to pursue. There are moments when I think, These are exactly the sorts of mistakes that administrations should be thrown out of office for. Then other considerations come into play. The first is Kerry. He's been attacked for being a flip-flopper, but his core trait is that he is monumentally selfish. Since joining the Senate, he has never attached himself to an idea or movement larger than his own career advancement. It's not for nothing that people in Massachusetts joked that his initials stand for Just For Kerry. Or that people spoke of him as the guy who refuses to wait in lines at restaurants because he thinks he's above everybody else. If the Democrats had nominated Dick Gephardt, this election wouldn't be close, but character is destiny, and Kerry's could be debilitating in the White House. Second, for the next many years the madrassas will be churning out young men who want to kill us. In embarking on a generational challenge to transform the Middle East, Bush has a strategy to defeat their ideology. While many around him understand the challenge, Kerry has no strategy. I fear his foreign policy would combine Carteresque pedantry with the cruel ''realism'' of the first Bush administration. Under the elder Bush, the realists paid lip service to democracy, but inevitably stood by whoever was in power at the moment: for Gorbachev and against the freedom-loving Lithuanians, for the Russian empire and against the independence-seeking Ukrainians. That passive approach was tolerable in the face of a dying Soviet Union. It is not in the face of radical Islam. Third, Kerry's Democrats seem to have no interest in reforming the entitlement programs that are asphyxiating government. Kerry merely promises to expand the status quo, thus punting on the central domestic challenge of our time. I'm not allowed to tell you how I'm going to resolve these contradictory impulses (Times policy). But if Kerry wins, I hope he'll pick three things he wants to do -- for the country, not himself -- and stick with them. And if Bush is re-elected, I hope he will see his win not as vindication, but as a second chance to act effectively on the visions that inspired hope in the first place.

So what transformed politics this time around? The rise of the Web log, or blog. The commentary of bloggers -- individuals or groups posting daily, hourly or second-by-second observations of and opinions on the campaign on their own Web sites -- helped shape the 2004 race. The Op-Ed page asked bloggers from all points on the political spectrum to say what they thought was the most important event or moment of the campaign that, we hope, comes to an end today. MICKEY KAUS,  www.kausfiles.com: John Kerry has been surprisingly successful running as a hawkish fighter against terrorism. Given this strategy, the most important moment of the campaign was President Bush's failure in the first debate to take Mr. Kerry's embarrassing vote against the 1991 gulf war and hang it firmly around his neck. Something like: ''Mr. Kerry, you say you want an international coalition. In 1991, we had an international coalition. You say you want United Nations support. We had United Nations support. Saddam had invaded a neighbor, unprovoked, across an internationally recognized border. And yet even then you voted against using force. Al Gore voted for the war. But you did not. If you wouldn't use force then'' etc., etc. It writes itself! Mr. Bush might also have pointed out that without the 1991 war, the inspection regime Mr. Kerry later valued so highly wouldn't have been installed. And if we hadn't dismantled Saddam Hussein's nuclear program in 1991, he might have been able to build the bomb. (Mr. Bush finally brought up the 1991 vote in the third debate, but still didn't make a big enough deal of it.) I'm for John Kerry, but George Bush let him skate past his biggest vulnerability and get back into the race. LORIE BYRD,  www.polipundit.com: An important event in the 2004 campaign was the Democratic convention. My analysis of the convention, written just hours after it ended, still holds true: ''In addition to the mistake Kerry made by placing too much emphasis on Vietnam, which will give extra importance to the opposition of Kerry by vet groups, he also messed up by not addressing his two-decade-long Senate record. Not only can Bush-Cheney now point out the record of votes Kerry didn't take the opportunity to explain or defend, but they can show that Kerry is trying to hide his Senate record.'' The convention set the stage for the advertisements from the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and the Bush-Cheney attack on Mr. Kerry's voting record. The convention produced little momentum for Mr. Kerry, and it wasn't until his strong debate performance on Sept. 30 that he finally got back into the running. If he loses, much of the blame can be traced back to that one week in July. JOHN HINDERAKER and SCOTT JOHNSON,  www.powerlineblog.com: The most important event of the campaign was the exposure of documents cited by ''60 Minutes'' in its report on President Bush's Air National Guard service as fraudulent. We participated in this exposure by asking our readers for information relevant to the documents' authenticity, and then by organizing and disseminating the information we received on topics like the typewriters of the early 1970's and arcane points of military protocol in the same era. We posted our observations about the ''60 Minutes'' documents on the morning of Sept. 9, the day after Dan Rather's report was broadcast. We updated the posting through the day as new information came in from readers. Within 12 hours, more than 500 other Web sites had linked to ours, millions of people were aware of the serious questions that had been raised about CBS's documents, and CBS News executives were on the defensive. When it became clear within a few days that the documents were indeed fake, it was widely recognized that journalism had changed forever. Never again will the mainstream news media be able to dictate the flow of information to the American people. Ana Marie Cox,  www.wonkette.com: I was all set to vote for George Bush even after finding out that he wouldn't let me marry Mary Cheney if I wanted to. And when he made the pronunciation of ''Lambeau Field'' a campaign issue? It seemed fair. After all, he's proved that not knowing the names of foreign leaders is much less important than correctly pronouncing the homes of popular sports teams. Of course, he totally sold me with the debates: any man who explains a mystery bulge as bad tailoring is more than confident enough to take on the Euroweenies. But in the end, with the fate of the free world at stake and all, I've got to go with the guy who would admit that sending thousands of American soldiers and Iraqi civilians to their deaths to protect us from imaginary weapons was, in fact, a mistake. JOANNE JACOBS,  www.joannejacobs.com: ''The terrorists laughed at the suffering of children, who'd gone for days without water, food or sleep, said a survivor of the Russian school seized by what A.P. calls 'rebels.''' That's how I started a Sept. 3 post on the Beslan massacre that killed at least 331 hostages. On Sept. 14, I linked to an Israeli newspaper article translated by another blogger about a 74-year-old teacher who died with his students: ''The terrorist allowed the teacher to wet one of the bibs of the children and pass it around to dampen the mouths of the little ones who were choking from thirst.'' The children wore bibs. The Beslan massacre was a brutal reminder of the ruthlessness of 21st century terrorists. I'm into nuance -- till terrorists shoot fleeing children in the back. Then I want a stubborn, single-minded president who's at war with evildoers. They're at war with us. DAVID ADESNIK,  www.oxblog.com: There was no single moment when America came to know for sure that Saddam Hussein didn't have weapons of mass destruction. Yet after the C.I.A.'s top weapons inspector, David Kay, told Congress in October 2003 that his team had failed to find any illegal weapons, the widespread conviction that we would find the weapons stockpiles disintegrated. From that point on, George Bush became profoundly vulnerable and a Democratic victory today became a serious possibility. John Kerry has not been able to capitalize on this vulnerability fully and effectively because he shared George Bush's mistaken belief. Yet imagine for a moment that Mr. Kay had found abundant stockpiles of outlawed weapons in Iraq. Would Mr. Kerry be able to insist that Mr. Bush started ''the wrong war in the wrong place and at the wrong time''? Would he be able to insist that alliances are a powerful weapon in the war on terrorism rather than a dangerous restraint on American power? I don't hold it against George Bush that he was wrong about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction, since Bill Clinton and John Kerry were just as wrong. But if Mr. Bush had been right about Iraq, it would have counted strongly in his favor and I would probably be voting for him today instead of John Kerry. GREG DJEREJIAN,  www.belgraviadispatch.com: One of the most important events in the campaign occurred in September during the visit to the United States of Prime Minister Ayad Allawi of Iraq. Until then, while I was leaning toward George Bush (despite my anger over Abu Ghraib), I remained open to the possibility of voting for John Kerry. But, as I wrote that day, I found the Kerry campaign's handling of Mr. Allawi's visit disgraceful. Joe Lockhart, a Kerry adviser, denigrated Mr. Allawi as a ''puppet.'' And Mr. Kerry himself all but called Mr. Allawi a liar during a press conference. I had hoped that instead of such sniping from the sidelines, Mr. Kerry would deign to attend Mr. Allawi's moving address to a joint session of Congress and even seek a private meeting with him. Mr. Kerry could have assured Mr. Allawi that whoever won in November, America would stand shoulder to shoulder with Iraq. In place of such statesmanship, however, Mr. Kerry chose to belittle Mr. Allawi. Aside from playing right into the handbook of Iraqi insurgents by reinforcing the notion that Mr. Allawi's government was a quisling regime, Mr. Kerry's conduct signaled a lack of real interest in Iraqi democratization. After all, Mr. Allawi embodied the beginning of Iraq's perilous journey toward genuine sovereignty. Mr. Kerry's irresponsible attacks spoke volumes. ANN ALTHOUSE,  www.althouse.blogspot.com: I'd grown used to waiting for John Kerry to reveal what he would do in Iraq. Though I'd voted for Al Gore and Bill Clinton, respectively, in the last two presidential elections, I needed to hear Mr. Kerry commit to success in the war. On April 14, at an event at the City College of New York, a man challenged Mr. Kerry to explain how his plan for Iraq differed from President Bush's. Mr. Kerry responded testily, ''You're not listening.'' I wrote on my blog at the time, ''If you still don't know what he would do differently from Bush, do you deserve to be snapped at for 'not listening'?'' After that, as I heard Mr. Kerry wriggle his way around the Iraq question one way and then another, I never forgot his willingness to blame the listener for not already seeing his answer, and my mistrust of John Kerry hardened into support for George Bush. KEVIN DRUM,  www.washingtonmonthly.com: Four years ago, Vice President Al Gore bungled his first presidential debate with George Bush. He sighed theatrically, he rolled his eyes heavenward and periodically crossed the stage to loom over Mr. Bush like an impatient schoolmarm. America was not amused, and four weeks later George Bush was elected president. Mr. Bush, of all people, should have learned an obvious lesson from this: don't treat John Kerry the way Al Gore treated you. And yet, inexplicably, on Sept. 30 that's exactly what he did. He looked bored. He rolled his head weakly. He sounded defensive and exasperated. And John Kerry, who had been a steady six or seven percentage points behind in the polls, suddenly closed to within two or three points. And then kept gaining. And maybe even gained enough to win. All because Mr. Kerry looked calm and presidential during the first debate while Mr. Bush looked vaguely affronted at the mere idea of having to share a stage with him. TOM BURKA,  www.tomburka.com: Even before he started his campaign in earnest this year, President Bush made a crucial and perhaps fatal misstep when he announced a manned mission to Mars in January -- and then abandoned the initiative as hastily as he had adopted it. In doing so, the president alienated the increasingly important group of voters who have given up and ''just want to get off Earth.'' ''Bush misunderestimated the importance of the 'Get me out of here' bloc,'' said Dr. Herb Flaggellum, a former thyroid doctor-turned-pundit. Exit polling will almost certainly show that in a sea of issues baffling undecided voters, Mr. Bush's lack of commitment to expensive space exploration was a deciding factor in the election today. That, and his failure to wear a receiver and earpiece in the first debate. J. Bradford DeLong,  www.j-bradford-delong.net: Last winter a small group of moderate Republicans tried to dislodge Vice President Dick Cheney from the ticket. Reporters for The National Journal found senior Republicans trying to generate groundswells for Mr. Cheney's replacement by former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York; Secretary of State Colin Powell; Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge; the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice; or Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader. The hope, I think, was that with Mr. Cheney out of the picture, Mr. Powell could then be the grand vizier for a ''reality-based'' security policy, and somebody like the United States trade representative, Robert Zoellick, could then be the grand vizier for a ''reality-based'' economic policy. Something similar had been accomplished in the 1980's, when James Baker, Howard Baker and George Shultz were given new responsibilities midway through the Reagan administration. In the 1980's the moderate Republicans tried and succeeded. In 2004 they tried and failed. And with their failure died the chance to drag the Bush administration out of incompetence and ideology. GLENN REYNOLDS,  www.instapundit.com: The biggest story of this campaign was the candid admission in July by Evan Thomas, assistant managing editor of Newsweek, that the press ''wants Kerry to win.'' Though this seemed significant at the time, it was only later -- with things like CBS's bogus-document scandal, and the attempted late hit about the alleged missing explosives -- that it became clear just how right Mr. Thomas was. Mr. Thomas has since suggested that press bias is probably not as influential as he first thought, but it has been abundantly clear that the press has been in the tank for Kerry/Edwards for several months. People have noticed. As I wrote in August: ''Elections come and go, politicians come and go, and pretty much all of them turn out to be disappointments one way or another. But the 'Fourth Estate' is a big part of the unelected permanent government that in many ways does more to run the country than the politicians. And it's unraveling before our very eyes, which I think is the biggest story of the election so far.'' It still is.

The sale will end Tyco's failed experiment with operating cables. Tyco, a leading supplier of undersea cable equipment, spent more than $2.5 billion laying more than 37,000 miles of undersea cable connecting three continents. By becoming a cable operator, Tyco entered its customers' business. And like its rivals, Tyco was stung by the slowdown in demand for new phone and data capacity after the telecommunications bubble collapsed four years ago. Many operators have gone bankrupt or sold their networks. Increasingly, Asian phone companies, including many former government monopolies, have been the buyers. ''It was a very bad idea for Tyco to compete with their customers,'' said Julian Rawle, an analyst at Pioneer Consulting in Boston. The Asian carriers ''are the ones with the capital and the impetus from deregulation to go out and pick up these distressed assets,'' he added. Tyco said in a release that in selling its cable unit, Tyco Global Network, it would ''sharpen its focus on core businesses,'' including electronics, health care and security. Yesterday, Tyco International said it earned $454 million, or 22 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, after losing $297 million, or 22 cents a share, in the same quarter last year. Sales grew 13 percent, to $10.4 billion, with revenue increasing in every division. Tyco lost money in the fourth quarter of 2003 after it wrote down the value of its cable network. In the last year, Tyco has eliminated 8,100 jobs and sold 27 other businesses. Tyco said it expected to earn $1.88 to $1.98 a share in 2005. By purchasing Tyco's network, Videsh Sanchar Nigam, which is known as VSNL and is part of the Tata Group, has become a major carrier of data between Asia and the United States. Tyco's trans-Pacific cable has 7.6 terabits of capacity, or more than three times as much as the combined capacity of all the other major cables on that route. Only a fraction of Tyco's cable is being used, while most of the other cables are nearing their limits. As a result, analysts said, VSNL can expect steady demand for several years. In January, VSNL's rival, Reliance Infocomm, bought a 31,000-mile undersea network run by Flag Telecom.

Some election-night hosts are planning slumber parties. Others are planning to fill the lulls with movies, poker games, burlesque dancers, contests and some drinking games that sound like a recipe for alcohol poisoning -- like one in which guests take a swig each time someone on television says ''dead heat.'' The first test of viewers' patience will come early in the evening, when most of the polling places are still open and the network anchors are under strict orders not to give away the results of the exit polls that have been circulating all afternoon among news organizations. The result in the past has sometimes been a version of the Dance of the Seven Veils, in which anchors or correspondents will pretend not to know what's happening in a state but give enough clues for the discerning viewer. They might allude to the high spirits at one campaign headquarters, or start speculating about what effect the loss of this state would have on the other candidate. ''I'll go into the Socratic zone and keep asking questions and hope that nobody on the panel will giggle it away,'' said Chris Matthews, the MSNBC anchor, who added that he would have on his best poker face to mask the exit-poll results. ''If somebody says something that I think is revelatory, I'll try do what they did on Indian footpaths -- I will rub away with my stick to make the footprints disappear.'' Inquiring minds, though, may be able to find some of the exit-poll results on the Internet well before the polls close. The leaked results have appeared on past Election Days in the Drudge Report and at Slate. Jacob Weisberg, the editor of Slate, said he planned to post the poll data again today if Slate gets it. ''The big news organizations withhold this data on the totally unproven theory that exit polls reduce turnout,'' Mr. Weisberg said. ''But even if there were real, as opposed to anecdotal, evidence to support the reduced turnout idea, I won't put Slate in the paternalistic position of deciding that our readers aren't mature enough to react in the proper way to truthful information we possess.'' If the race in some states is as close as predicted, it will take more than exit-poll results to project the winner. And if the margins in the battleground states are anything like the one in Florida in 2000, that could mean another all-nighter. ''I'm telling guests to bring their pajamas,'' said Virginia Sloan, a veteran of past Democratic presidential campaigns who is holding a party for 40 people at her home in Washington. To keep her guests entertained, Ms. Sloan will have six television sets (including one in the bathroom) tuned to different networks, as well as a couple of laptop computers. ''I hope the guests don't have to wear the pajamas,'' she said, ''but we're prepared for a long night. We're laying in a lot of food.'' In New York, the Darklight club in Chelsea is holding what it calls a slumber party featuring election coverage on a big screen as well as go-go dancers in red, white and blue. ''They'll be doing old-school, kitschy performances with patriotic or political themes,'' said Bryan Davis, a co-owner of the club. ''It's more of a burlesque show than a strip show, although they do take their clothes off sometimes.'' Those watching at home will have to content themselves with the networks' talking heads as the night wears on, which can be a strain on viewers as well as the anchors. Brit Hume, the anchor of the Fox News Channel broadcast, said he hoped it would not be a repeat of the 2000 marathon. ''Filling time gets to be hard,'' Mr. Hume said. ''What can really be dreadful is when nothing's happening and you're going to a crowded ballroom where the band's playing and you've got some poor correspondent who can't hear what you're saying. You also worry about getting personally incoherent -- you suddenly realize you uttered a sentence and you have no idea what it means.'' So what should a viewer do if it's a really long night?

The question, framed in a lawsuit brought by a woman whose estranged husband murdered their three young daughters, is whether the failure by the police to enforce a protective court order she had obtained violated her constitutional right to due process. The lower courts have confronted the question numerous times in recent years and have produced conflicting answers. In the case the justices accepted, the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, voted 6 to 5 to permit the woman's lawsuit, against the town of Castle Rock, Colo., to proceed to trial. The federal district court in Denver had dismissed the suit, in which the plaintiff, Jessica Gonzales, is seeking $30 million in compensatory damages and millions more in punitive damages. Colorado law makes it mandatory for the police to provide protection once a protective order is issued. ''A peace officer shall use every reasonable means to enforce a protection order,'' the state law provides. In addition, the law requires the police to make an arrest if they have probable cause to believe that such an order has been violated. Many other states have similar laws. The appeals court's majority reasoned that the law gave Colorado residents a vested right to receive a particular government service, police protection, that cannot be withheld without procedural safeguards intended to prevent the government from acting in an arbitrary way. The case will require the Supreme Court to revisit a doctrine articulated by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist in a well-known case from 1989, in which a county social services department in Wisconsin was found not to have breached a constitutional duty when it returned a young boy to an abusive father and then failed to monitor his safety. That decision, DeShaney v. Winnebago County, established the rule that the government is not ordinarily obliged to protect people from harm at the hands of their fellow private citizens. The DeShaney opinion was based on a branch of constitutional analysis known as ''substantive due process.'' The 14th Amendment bars the states from depriving ''any person of life, liberty, or property'' without due process, and the substantive due process question asks whether the challenged government action has violated any of those three guarantees. ''Nothing in the language of the Due Process Clause itself requires the State to protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors,'' Chief Justice Rehnquist said in his opinion. The 14th Amendment also has a procedural component: even if the state has a permissible reason for impinging on the amendment's substantive protections, it must use due process proper procedures in doing so. In the DeShaney case, Chief Justice Rehnquist said the question of whether the county had used proper procedures in its care for the child had not been properly presented to the court. Consequently, the ruling has been interpreted by some lower courts as not foreclosing a procedural ruling in a future case. That was the approach the 10th Circuit took in the new case, Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, No. 04-278. The majority said Ms. Gonzales had presented a plausible case that the police had failed to follow proper procedure in disregarding her repeated requests for help after her husband had kidnapped the three girls -- ages 7, 9 and 10 -- from the yard of their house on the afternoon of June 22, 1999. Ms. Gonzales reported the girls missing, telling the officers who arrived at her house that she suspected her husband and feared that he might be violent. She showed the officers a copy of the restraining order she had obtained a month earlier in connection with their divorce case. But the police failed to take any action, even when Ms. Gonzales learned that her husband, Simon Gonzales, was with the girls at a local amusement park. She called the police repeatedly and went to the police station herself after midnight. At 3:20 in the morning, Mr. Gonzales arrived at the police station in a truck, opened fire with a semiautomatic handgun he had bought the previous day and was shot dead at the scene. The bodies of the three girls were in the cab of the truck. In its Supreme Court appeal, the town's lawyer argued that by permitting the lawsuit to proceed, the 10th Circuit's decision threatened to ''convert hundreds of procedural mandates into constitutional claims'' and could ''bankrupt'' municipal governments for their inevitable instances of ''less than perfect'' law enforcement. ''Federal courts should not lay such a heavy hand on evolving state efforts to address such quintessentially local issues of crime and violence,'' the brief said. The town is supported in its appeal by the National League of Cities and the International Municipal Lawyers Association. The justices also announced Monday that the court would hear arguments in a territorial dispute between Alaska and the federal government over the ownership of underwater land within the boundaries of the Tongass National Forest and the Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. A special master appointed by the court four years ago, Gregory E. Maggs, recommended awarding the disputed territory to the United States. The court will hear Alaska's appeal in Alaska v.

But never before has getting it right posed such a challenge. The networks and The Associated Press have devised a system to avoid a repeat of 2000, when Florida was called for Al Gore, then for George W. Bush and then, in the wee hours, for neither. And the networks, which have enacted their own stopgaps to detect any errors that the new system might produce, are going into Election Day with a brave and flashy face that they hope will restore their pride after the mess in 2000. NBC News, for instance, has set up an American history exhibit at Rockefeller Center and renamed it ''Democracy Plaza'' for its coverage from there. CNN has rented the Nasdaq site in Times Square. But for all the hoopla, a crop of new complications has arisen this year that leaves room for error, and at the very least could give the networks difficulty in declaring a winner tonight, network officials said. Several states remain too close to predict, raising the potential for more than one recount. More people are voting early and by mail than ever before, escaping the watchful eye of network exit pollsters who are crucial for Election Night projections. And hundreds of thousands are expected to vote using provisional ballots, which might not be counted for days, and which lawyers are likely to challenge anyway. ''We had determined coming off of 2000 that we would be extra cautious in 2004, and we've done a lot to improve the various information systems to ensure we have the best handle on what's going on,'' said Bill Wheatley, an NBC News vice president. ''Having said that, clearly it's close in many states.'' ''There are a number of imponderables,'' Mr. Wheatley added, ''so that gives us all the more reason to be cautious.'' One network news executive, who agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity, put it more starkly: ''We're all petrified about getting it wrong.'' Officials at every major news network said they were instructing their anchors and analysts to avoid declaring a result in any state where they are uncertain about the outcome, no matter what others have reported -- essentially asking competitive network news reporters to quash an instinct as natural as drinking water. To a one, they vowed they would not make any erroneous calls. ''The last thing we want to do is to have to take something back, to make a correction,'' said Kathleen A. Frankovic, the director of surveys for CBS News. And, in a break from past elections, the networks have vowed not to call any state before all of its polls are closed, one of several lessons learned from 2000. The misreporting of the 2000 vote seemed at the time to be a singular event, caused by an unusually close vote that exposed flaws in a system upon which the major news outlets had been dependably relying for a decade. The system, called Voter News Service, was set up to provide exit polls and actual vote tabulations and was run by ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox News, CNN and The Associated Press. Dozens of major news organizations, including The New York Times, subscribed to the service. News executives said flaws in the exit polling data in 2000 helped lead them to first call Florida for Mr. Gore. Later, the system's failure to detect an erroneous drop in the vote tally for Mr. Gore in Volusia County helped lead them to report that Mr. Bush had won the state. Republicans complained that the early declaration that Mr. Gore won Florida depressed last-minute turnout in the conservative Panhandle, where polls closed an hour later than in the rest of the state, diminishing Mr. Bush's vote there. Democrats said the later call for Mr. Bush prompted Mr. Gore to concede prematurely and sent him into the recount looking like a sore loser. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing at which news executives were forced to answer for themselves. Warren Mitofsky and Joe Lenski, the independent pollsters who devised the system that is replacing the Voter News Service, said the networks most likely would have not made the same mistakes if the new system had been in place in 2000. For instance, they said, the new system would have produced a visible red flag when Volusia County produced the erroneous vote count for Mr. Gore. The system will also raise flags when a county's data is out of keeping with its voting history. The men said exit polls should also be more representative this time because exit polling in 13 states will be supplemented with telephone surveys of voters who used absentee ballots or voted early. The old system only did so in three states. But where the old system produced independent vote tabulations that could be used to confirm those of the Associated Press -- and vice versa -- the new system will not have such a safeguard. No network is planning to rely solely on the system, and each has plans to help it apply the brakes before declaring a state, or the election, won. Dan Merkle, director of the decision desk at ABC News, will oversee a team that will review every call the network analysts make before they are relayed to the anchor Peter Jennings for public consumption. Mr. Merkle said the network would most likely not declare a winner in any state where the gap between winner and loser was less than two percentage points. Marty Ryan, executive producer for political programs for Fox News Channel, said he would have the network's anchor and legal analyst, Greta Van Susteren, in place to deal with legal issues that could cloud the votes of key states. ''We're going to be prepared for all the contingencies,'' he said. David Bohrman, who is overseeing CNN's coverage, said his network would have its legal experts in place, too. And Mr. Wheatley said NBC News was promoting a phone number for viewers to call to report problems at the polls, information that can be figured into projection calculations. For all of that, nobody was ready to predict smooth sailing. ''We're certainly not going to make the same mistakes we made last time,'' Mr. Mitofsky said. ''It's always possible to find new ways to make mistakes.'' He hastened to add, ''But everything we know about has been more than covered.''

The Golden State's roads are known for vintage T-birds, customized muscle cars and the Bentleys in Beverly Hills. But the state's regulators have a different kind of cool in mind -- cars that emit significantly lower amounts of the gases that have been linked to global warming. When California adopted the nation's first automotive greenhouse gas regulation in September, the auto industry and state regulators disagreed over how much it would all cost. The new regulation would require a 30 percent reduction, on average, in automotive greenhouse gas emissions -- carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane -- by the 2016 model year. The regulation, though directed at greenhouse gases, would probably demand an improvement in fuel economy of more than 40 percent. While smog-forming pollutants have been regulated for decades, catalytic converters can neutralize those emissions. But no filtration technology exists for greenhouse gas emissions, so cutting those emissions would have to come almost entirely from better fuel economy, though a modest amount could be cut by overhauling a car's air-conditioner. The staff of the California Air Resources Board says the new regulation will add about $1,000 to the cost of an average vehicle, but they said they believed that cost could be made up in five years in savings at the gasoline pump. The industry, by contrast, said it would add $3,000, a cost that would never fully be made up by fuel savings. If the regulation survives a legal challenge from the auto industry, New York has indicated it wants to follow California's lead. Several other Northeastern states that hew closely to California's air quality standards may also follow suit. So how would cars and trucks have to change? The Union of Concerned Scientists, a leading environmental group lobbying for the regulation, recently issued a report on how six specific vehicles could be modified to reduce global warming emissions by 40 percent or more, exceeding the California standards. The group projected that, for a cost of $1,960 per vehicle, the 2003 model Ford Explorer XLT, with a V-6 engine, could be modified to reduce its greenhouse gas production by 43 percent, a change that would improve fuel economy by more than 70 percent. (California's standards require that emissions from vehicles in the Explorer's weight class be reduced by 24.5 percent by 2016.) The report contends that buyers could make up that added cost in a little over three years by spending less on gasoline. Thomas C. Austin, the consultant employed by the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry lobbying group, to argue against the California regulation, conducted an analysis of the environmental group's projections. (The Ford Motor Company declined to offer its own analysis, referring questions to the alliance.) Mr. Austin said that according to his analysis it would cost $4,361 a vehicle to make the modifications proposed by the environmental group, and that some changes were not feasible. He also projected a somewhat lower reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The two sides disagreed about almost every aspect of cost projections because of different methodologies and sources. ''They look for what's been published to support the case to encourage government agencies to further regulate,'' Mr. Austin said of the Union of Concerned Scientists, noting that to make its case, the group used ''the most optimistic projections of fuel economy improvements and the most optimistic projections of cost.'' Environmentalists and California regulators argue that the industry's recalcitrance is no surprise, citing its history of opposing everything from safety belts to small increases in fuel economy standards. ''The industry has a long track record of underestimating potential and overestimating cost,'' said Louise Bedsworth, the senior vehicles analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, who wrote the report. ''We've seen it on many safety regulations; we continually see this pattern of pushing back, but in most areas we've seen them come through and succeed in the end.'' Here are major modifications that Ms. Bedsworth would make to an Explorer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and Mr. Austin's comments on those proposals. Aerodynamics For starters, the Explorer, a sport utility vehicle, would need to be a lot rounder. Ms. Bedsworth said automakers could modestly reduce emissions by improving aerodynamics because cars and trucks that are less wind resistant are more fuel efficient. ''The Explorer is a pretty boxy S.U.V.,'' she said, a shape that makes it less aerodynamic. Two current S.U.V.'s, Honda's Acura MDX and the Volvo XC90, made by Ford, are significantly more aerodynamic than the Explorer because of more rounded styling. The company could also cover the underside with paneling to smooth over nooks that hinder wind flow. Mr. Austin said that Ms. Bedsworth's proposals would make the Explorer an ugly duckling. Some of the most iconic vehicles of the day are characterized by boxiness, from the Hummer to the Chrysler 300C. ''It's been decades since the auto industry showed you could produce vehicles that had half the drag coefficient than vehicles do today,'' he said. ''But look at them. To most people, they're not the kind of cars they want to drive.'' Ms. Bedsworth said Ford could also extend the Explorer's steel body over the tops of the tires to improve wind resistance, the way Honda designed the body of its tiny hybrid electric car, the Insight. But Mr. Austin said ''most people think the Honda Insight is an ugly car.'' Tweaking the Tires Some new tires improve fuel efficiency with designs and materials that lessen the force needed to propel them down the road. Ms. Bedsworth says she believes further improvements are possible, but Mr. Austin said new federal tire pressure regulations might induce automakers to use larger tires that would impede efficiency gains. Mike Wischhusen, the director of industry standards and government regulations at Michelin, said changing tire size would not necessarily change fuel economy performance by itself. His company's chief executive, Eduoard Michelin, recently outlined a goal of improving tire performance, as it relates to fuel economy, by 50 percent by 2020. Under the Hood Ms. Bedsworth said a variety of technologies could be combined to improve efficiency under the hood. A 42-volt starter generator, a mild form of hybrid technology, would allow the Explorer to shut down at stoplights. The modified Explorer's engine would also combine three technologies that are in use today, though not all in one vehicle. The altered S.U.V. would have a diesel-like direct-injection gasoline engine that puts air and fuel directly into the engine cylinders rather than into precombustion chambers. The engine would also employ variable valve timing, a technology that ensures that the engine valves open and close in the most efficient manner, and cylinder deactivation, which shuts down one-half of the engine if it's not needed. Mr. Austin said the last two technologies ''don't make engineering sense'' when packaged together because they were so similar in nature that using them jointly would not be worthwhile. Ms. Bedsworth said Honda employed both technologies in its Odyssey minivans, but only one technology -- variable valve timing or cylinder deactivation -- was used in each minivan, depending on the version. Ms. Bedsworth said there would still be some added benefit to using both. ''The package still comes out to be cost effective,'' she said. Increased engine efficiency would slightly increase, to 230 from 210, the horsepower of the 2003 model Explorer used in the study. Improved Air-Conditioning The industry is almost certain to argue in its legal challenge that the California regulation is pre-empted by Washington's authority to regulate fuel economy. But environmentalists point out that tweaking a vehicle's air-conditioning system is one way to get modest emissions reductions independent of fuel economy improvements. The refrigerant used in automobile air-conditioners, known as HFC-134a, is a heat-trapping gas that is even more damaging than carbon dioxide. An improved air-conditioner could contain the gas better, or alternatively, a different type of refrigerant could be used. Weight Loss? Mr. Austin said to achieve the kind of emissions reductions proposed by the Union of Concerned Scientists, or the lesser reductions required by the California regulation, the Explorer would have to be significantly lighter. ''Our analysis indicates that weight reduction is a more cost-effective way to improve fuel economy than some of the other measures that would otherwise be required,'' Mr. Austin said. The use of lightweight materials like aluminum, and the cost of redesign, would add more than $1,000 to the vehicle cost, he said. But Ms. Bedsworth disagreed, saying that the Explorer's weight would not have to change to meet the emissions standards. Savings at the Gas Pump Mr. Austin disagreed with projections used by California regulators to gauge how many miles the average vehicle in the state is in service. Those projections are critical to making a cost-benefit analysis of the new standard. He also disputed the discount rate the Union of Concerned Scientists used to calculate the current value of future fuel savings. Ms. Bedsworth said her projections were conservative, pointing to the $1.68-a-gallon gas price used in her analysis. Gasoline costs $2.39 a gallon, on average, in California, according to the most recent estimate from the Energy Information Administration.", "title": "Peering at the Sticker on a Cleaner Car; California's New Emissions Standards Ignite a Debate Over Price"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/Business", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/California", "Top/News/U.S./West", "Top/News", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Activities and Interests/Road Trips", "Top/Classifieds/Automobiles/Topics/Green Tech", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/California"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Business", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Business/Financial Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "C", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/business/02emissions.html", "print_column": "2", "slug": "02EMIS$02"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Marsh & McLennan, which the New York attorney general's office has accused of bid-rigging and price-fixing, said last night that it was setting up a fund to be used for restitution in any settlement agreement. Marsh, the world's largest insurance broker, indicated that the fund could initially have up to $230 million. In a statement, the broker said the money would come from longstanding incentive agreements with insurance companies. It suspended the agreements on Oct. 15, the day after Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general, accused Marsh in a civil lawsuit of cheating customers. Mr. Spitzer said that the incentive agreements, known as contingency fees or placement service agreements, were at the heart of his lawsuit. He said the payments to Marsh, for meeting sales and profitability targets for the insurers, represented a fundamental conflict of interest. Several other brokers have stopped taking this type of payments. Marsh gave no explanation for what prompted the announcement about the fund, and a spokesman would not elaborate. Darren Dopp, a spokesman for Mr. Spitzer, said the decision to set aside the money was made by Marsh on its own and was not imposed by the attorney general as part of a settlement. ''There is still a lot of investigating and actions to do before there is any resolution,'' Mr. Dopp said. ''We're not at the point where any settlement agreement is under way.'' Mr. Dopp said that the new chief executive of Marsh, Michael G. Cherkasky, called Mr. Spitzer's office yesterday to report the move. In the statement, Marsh said for the first time that it intended to collect from the insurers money that it had expected to receive under incentive agreements in place before Oct. 15. Marsh had not previously mentioned the issue. This part of the statement raised the possibility that insurance companies had begun to resist making the payments after Marsh suspended the agreements. But that could not be determined last night. Marsh said it had calculated that $230 million was outstanding as of Sept. 30. It did not say how much it estimated it was owed for the first half of October. Any settlement of the case, according to people briefed on the investigation, is expected to take much more than $230 million.

Last week, prices reached a record $55.65 a barrel. Oil prices rose steadily over the summer as analysts and traders feared that supplies from oil-producing countries like Iraq, Russia and Nigeria could be interrupted at a time when demand, especially from Asia, was surging at an unexpected pace. But while oil producers are pumping at record levels to keep up with consumption, few of the market's concerns about supplies have materialized. ''This price isn't justified,'' said Doug Leggate, an analyst at Citigroup. ''The idea that there is a shortage is nonsense. The reality is that the market is oversupplied.'' On the day before the presidential election, some traders were speculating that a victory by Senator John Kerry over President Bush would lead to a change in energy policy in the United States. For the market, the most immediate policy difference between the candidates is their position on government-owned oil stockpiles. The Bush administration has consistently rejected calls to stop adding oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Releasing oil from the reserve could lower prices, but Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have repeatedly said they would use the reserves only in an emergency. Mr. Kerry has said that given the strength of market demand, the government should stop adding to the reserve until prices drop. ''You have basically two different attitudes to the reserves: one that is essentially security-centric and opposed to market intervention, while the other has a more central-bank attitude towards it,'' said Jamal Qureshi, an oil market analyst at PFC Energy, a consulting firm in Washington. The reserve, which the Bush administration began refilling in November 2001, now has 670 million barrels of oil, the equivalent of 56 days of imports. The oil is stored in four underground salt caverns along the Gulf coasts of Texas and Louisiana. Oil from the reserve was last released in 2000, under President Bill Clinton. The election ''is so close, people are hedging their bets,'' Mr. Qureshi said. ''A Kerry administration would also be more likely to approve a release in strategic reserves.'' For the last two years, traders have widely expected disruptions in oil supplies. That has contributed to the price increase because companies are producing oil as quickly as they can, leaving the global market vulnerable to any interruption. But so far, the only thing that has hurt production in the United States has been Hurricane Ivan, which caused a shortfall in output from the Gulf of Mexico in September. Iraq still produces more than 2 million barrels a day and exports 90 percent of it; Russian exports have not been affected by the tussle between the government and the country's largest oil company, Yukos; and in Venezuela, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez remains in power after defeating a national vote calling for his removal. ''There's an idea that Iraq is producing pretty steadily now and that Nigeria is calming down,'' said Jay Saunders, an oil analyst at Deutsche Bank. Expectations of a cold winter in the Northeast part of the United States also pushed up prices in recent weeks, ''but people have gotten ahead of themselves,'' Mr. Saunders said.

As Mr. Elgindy appeared to listen carefully, prosecutors accused him of participating in a stock-selling arrangement by conspiring with Jeffrey A. Royer, an F.B.I. agent who was also in court, to publish confidential government information about small, thinly traded companies as a way of gaining an unfair advantage in the market. His lawyers said that Mr. Elgindy was using his stock-advisory Web sites to expose phony companies, and that the conspiracy the prosecutors suggested did not make sense. Mr. Elgindy took notes as prosecutors portrayed him as an opportunist, seeking personal profit. His lawyers, quoting a government lawyer he once assisted, described him as a ''crusader for propriety in the marketplace.'' He sat silently, with his family looking on from the front row of the courtroom, while prosecutors said that Mr. Elgindy boarded a plane in April using a false name and credentials. His lawyer dismissed the claim as a red herring and ''putty to fill in the holes'' in the government's case. But what the jury never heard, and its admissibility is still to be decided, is perhaps the most speculative contention in the case: that Mr. Elgindy knew in advance about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and rather than report the threat, he attempted to profit from the attacks. Judge Raymond J. Dearie said in a pretrial session yesterday that he would not allow the claim in opening statements but that he would broach the subject as the trial continued. ''I think it is part and parcel to the case,'' Judge Dearie said, ''but I want to know what the government wants to elicit from its witnesses.'' The trial is expected to shed some light on the relationship between short-sellers like Mr. Elgindy, who may profit by raising questions about companies, and regulators, who often rely on the short-seller's tips and sometimes share information to benefit their own investigations. In a straightforward opening statement, prosecutors outlined their case against Mr. Elgindy. ''This is a case about fraud, corruption and betrayal,'' said Valerie Szczepanik, assistant district attorney. Ms. Szczepanik contended that Mr. Elgindy and his associates used information obtained from F.B.I. databases to drive down the price of stocks they were trading or planned to sell short. From November 2000 to May 2002, she said, Mr. Royer provided Mr. Elgindy and Derrick Cleveland, a business associate, with information about investigations into small and thinly traded companies. Mr. Cleveland testified yesterday as a government witness in exchange for pleading guilty to a related securities fraud conspiracy charge. Ms. Szczepanik said that under the pretext of working to expose fraudulent companies, Mr. Elgindy would secretly sell his stocks short and then would release negative news about the companies to subscribers of two Web sites he operated, hoping to drive down the price of the stocks even further to maximize his gain. Ms. Szczepanik said that Mr. Elgindy was an opportunist ''who saw Agent Royer as his winning lottery ticket.'' Prosecutors also accused Mr. Elgindy of engaging in extortion by using information obtained through the government databases to threaten a Florida company and its chief executive. Barry Berke, a lawyer for Mr. Elgindy, said that his client deserved to be praised, not prosecuted, for his work exposing phony companies. He used the opening statement to debunk the government's case. He conceded that Mr. Elgindy was a businessman, but he said that his client and the investors who subscribed to his Web sites also wanted to expose fraud. ''These people would become like junior detectives,'' Mr. Berke said, citing several company schemes that he contended Mr. Elgindy helped uncover and prodded the government to examine. He said that Mr. Elgindy experienced death threats and lawsuits and was a ''lightning rod'' for those who did not like him challenging their businesses. Federal prosecutors acknowledged that Mr. Elgindy sometimes contacted law enforcement officials, but Ms. Szczepanik maintained that ''any tips to law enforcement were to enrich his own pockets.''

Ovitz, the ousted president of the Walt Disney Company, ended five days of testimony on Monday by defending the hundreds of thousands of dollars he spent on gifts, entertainment and charitable contributions as a way to give employees a pat on the back, generate good will and soften Disney's image with power brokers. ''The entertainment business is very much about favors,'' Mr. Ovitz said when questioned by a lawyer for the shareholders, Steven Schulman, about the Disney character toys he handed out, and about more elaborate gifts like the $601 in jewelry and food he gave to the talk-show host David Letterman. Lunch with people like Variety's editor, Peter Bart, helped ''to keep good relationships with the trades,'' Mr. Ovitz said, and a $25,000 contribution to the Museum of Modern Art, where he is a trustee, helped Disney's visibility in New York, where rivals like Time Warner donate millions. In January 1997, shareholders sued Disney directors; Mr. Ovitz; and the chief executive, Michael D. Eisner, asserting that Mr. Ovitz should have been fired for gross negligence rather than being terminated without cause. They want the defendants to return Mr. Ovitz's $140 million severance package plus interest, and they say that they should have been better informed about the decision to hire Mr. Ovitz and the terms of his contract. In pretrial testimony, Mr. Eisner said he had been trying to hire his friend, Mr. Ovitz, for 20 years. ''I had been trying to get him on my side because I couldn't do business with him because he was too tough, so I thought he would be better to be on our side.'' Mr. Ovitz said on Monday that he finally agreed to join Disney in August 1995, two months after his negotiations to join MCA fell through. His partner at Creative Artists Agency, Ron Meyer, got that job, just as Newsweek came out with a cover article anticipating Mr. Ovitz's move to MCA and calling him the most powerful man in Hollywood. Mr. Ovitz attributed the problems of his 14 months at Disney to Mr. Eisner's failure to act when two senior executives told Mr. Ovitz on the day he was hired that they would never report to him. ''I was very unhappy,'' he said, but he trusted Mr. Eisner ''1,000 percent because he said he would work it out.'' After his testimony, Mr. Ovitz told reporters outside the courthouse that he would not know how he felt until the chancellor, William B. Chandler III, ruled. ''But I couldn't be happier that I had the opportunity to give my side,'' he said. ''I have been waiting for seven years to get this out and what better condition than under oath.'' He said he was self-employed, working as a consultant and in investment, and making some deals. ''I've lost seven years of my business life and coming out of that Disney thing I was tainted,'' he said, adding that people have begun calling him after reading accounts of the trial. ''My side came out,'' he said. His hope is that the ''company gets off, I get off and that verdict will allow me to move on.'' Before leaving, he repeated statements that he believed that Mr. Eisner was the ''best executive in the business, but as a friend, that was not the most positive way to end a relationship of 25 years.'' When asked about Mr. Eisner's statement in a deposition that they had had dinner twice in recent years, Mr. Ovitz said they had really happened to be at the same event. He was followed on the witness stand by Irwin Russell, a retired Disney director who was Mr. Eisner's lawyer and was instrumental in negotiating Mr. Ovitz's contract. Mr. Russell said that the first time he heard Mr. Ovitz speak in the 1970's he was ''very impressed'' with his intelligence and straightforwardness. In 1995, he drafted Mr. Ovitz's compensation package to make it consistent with the Disney compensation policies. He said the base salary of $1 million was at the lower end of the market; bonuses were awarded to make up for that; and stock options were seen as an efficient and economical way to reward employees because the company did not have to account for them as costs and the employee could deduct them from taxes. ''There was some dilution of shareholder equity,'' he said. ''But Wall Street and all other people seemed to accept that. Executives made substantial gains with them.'' Lawyers said they expected Mr. Russell to testify the rest of a week shortened by two court holidays: Election Day on Tuesday and in Georgetown, Del., an event known since 1792 as Return Day, when rival candidates sit together in a parade intended to bury the election hatchet.

With nearly 95 percent of the returns counted by Monday evening, Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich had received 40 percent of the vote on Sunday to replace President Leonid D. Kuchma. That put him less than 1 percentage point ahead of Viktor A. Yushchenko, a former prime minister and central bank chairman who became Mr. Kuchma's foremost critic. The count, which reflected deep regional, ethnic and social divisions among Ukraine's 47 million people, forces a runoff on Nov. 21. Given the tenor of the campaign so far, which featured evidence of government abuses, intimidation and occasional episodes of violence, the results set the stage for a fierce final clash between two men with strikingly divergent visions of the country's future. Mr. Yushchenko's campaign reported many abuses on the day of the election, saying they called into question the final results. Mr. Yanukovich's campaign also reported polling problems. On Monday, a coalition of international observers from Europe agreed, but laid most of the blame for irregularities, before and during the vote, on Mr. Kuchma's government, which had thrown its resources behind Mr. Yanukovich. The observers -- representing the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe, the European Union and NATO -- cited what they called overwhelming bias in the state-controlled news media, the blurring of state and campaign resources on Mr. Yanukovich's behalf and evidence of official interference in his opponents' campaigns. ''Elections must be won or lost by the will of the people, honestly expressed and honestly reflected in the counting of the votes,'' said Bruce George, a Briton who led the observer mission. He called the election ''a step backward'' from parliamentary elections held in 2002, which were also criticized as falling short of basic European standards. Among the most serious irregularities was the absence of voters from the voter lists. The observers reported problems in 40 percent of all polling stations. Each camp conducted its own count, with contradictory results that put its candidate ahead, though not by significant margins. Mr. Yushchenko appeared before supporters early Monday to declare a victory for Ukraine's ''democratic forces.'' Though his campaign aides declared him the victor again later in the day, they stopped short of calling the final results invalid. ''The election showed it is possible to struggle against power,'' Oleksandr O. Zinchenko, a member of Parliament and chairman of Mr. Yushchenko's campaign, said Monday afternoon. ''It showed there is opposition to the ruling regime.'' In a sign of the opposition's relative satisfaction with the results, a protest planned for Monday in Kiev attracted only a few hundred people, who gathered peacefully and pledged to continue campaigning for a Yushchenko victory in the runoff. Mr. Yanukovich, like Mr. Yushchenko, did not appear publicly as the results were announced. His campaign, however, released a statement early in the day quoting him as saying, ''The main achievement is that we managed to uphold peace and calm in our country.'' Mr. Yanukovich has vowed to continue much of Mr. Kuchma's legacy. While Mr. Kuchma tilted alternately toward Russia and Western Europe, Mr. Yanukovich promised to cultivate closer ties with Russia, proposing to make Russian an official language and to allow dual citizenship. He also promised to end the country's flirtation with NATO and European Union membership, emphasizing historic ties with Russia instead. His campaign has received high-profile support from Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Yushchenko, by contrast, has promised a more balanced approach, even as he vowed to attack what he called the corruption of Mr. Kuchma's government. He has campaigned as a Western-style democrat who would cultivate closer ties with the rest of Europe, though not at the expense of Russia. Although seen as more sympathetic to the United States, he has also vowed to withdraw Ukraine's 1,600 troops from Iraq, a deployment widely viewed here as an effort by Mr. Kuchma to improve relations with the Bush administration. Both sides will now court the other 22 candidates for support. In distant third and fourth places were Oleksandr O. Moroz, the Socialist who received nearly 6 percent of the votes, and Petro M. Symonenko, the Communist who received 5 percent. Mr. Moroz indicated that he was prepared to negotiate endorsement of Mr. Yushchenko, according to Ukrainian news reports, while Mr. Symonenko has not said whom he will support.", "title": "Ukraine Vote For President In Virtual Tie; Runoff Is Due"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Ukraine", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Russia and the Former Soviet Union", "Top/News/World", "Top/News/World/Europe", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Government, Philanthropy and NGO", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe/Ukraine"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "World", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Foreign Desk", "print_page_number": "8", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/international/europe/02ukraine.html", "print_column": "3", "slug": "02UKRA$03"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Leann Harrington's experience losing her job has an all-too-familiar ring, one that is soon likely to be heard with even greater frequency. The textile plant where she was employed shut down last year, a victim of fierce foreign competition. After scrambling, she was lucky to land a job as manager and waitress at the Towel City Junction Cafe, earning $3 an hour plus tips, a fraction of her factory wages. For many years, textile and clothing factories in the mill towns of the Carolinas -- originally drawn from New York and New England decades ago by the prospect of inexpensive nonunion workers -- have been closing one after another as the industry migrated abroad in search of ever-cheaper labor. Now, this gradual loss may be about to turn into a rout. On Jan. 1, the global system of country-by-country quotas regulating the $495 billion international trade in textiles and apparel is scheduled to be eliminated. That will transform the vast business in ways that were barely glimpsed a decade ago, when the newly created World Trade Organization went along with the demands of developing countries and agreed to phase out the quotas imposed by advanced nations to protect their own industries. Today, though, poor countries at the bottom of the economic ladder, like Cambodia and Bangladesh, have a new fear: China. It is the colossus in the field, home to a seemingly endless supply of workers available to feed vast numbers of suppliers operating with high efficiency and low costs in ways that threaten to overwhelm competition from developing countries except India, Pakistan and Brazil. For China and other big developing nations with expanding apparel industries, the end of the quotas will mean tens of millions of new factory jobs for people without work or barely scraping out a living. But for dozens of even poorer Asian and African countries now relying on their clothing exports to gain a foothold in the global economy, it could be still another bitter pill to swallow. The quotas they fought so hard to eliminate had ensured that their products would have at least a narrow opening in American and European markets. Without rules, though, restricting how much fabric or how many garments they can buy from any country, name brands and merchants like Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, J.C. Penney and the Gap will purchase most of what they want from five or six countries, not the 50-plus countries that are now part of their networks. Meanwhile, here in the slowly beating heart of the remaining American textile industry, workers and owners of factories still operating along a stretch of Interstate 85 from Charlotte to Greensboro see the dawning of 2005 as a death sentence. More companies, they fear, will go bankrupt. More communities will wither like Kannapolis, and thousands more workers will be desperate for training, employment and health insurance. In hopes of staving off the worst, politicians in the Southeast from both parties are taking advantage of the close outlook for the presidential election to win last-minute concessions from the White House that could slow the flood of imports from China. And, seriously weakened as it is, the American textile and apparel industry is still flexing its political muscles. [On Oct. 29, days before the election, the Bush administration accepted the industry's petition seeking relief, promising to consider special steps to limit Chinese exports.] Most experts expect that China, left unimpeded, will gain almost half the global apparel market. Its factories now make about 20 percent of the clothing and textiles sold in the United States; China is expected to capture as much as 70 percent of that market, potentially leading to the closing of half the surviving American mills and layoffs for tens of thousands more workers. Fashion executives say that those fears are exaggerated and that American manufacturers have already weathered the worst. ''Yes, China will benefit because of the quality of its goods,'' said Robert J. Zane, senior vice president for sourcing, manufacturing, logistics and distribution at Liz Claiborne in New York. ''But it will be more at the expense of other Asian countries than at the expense of the American industry.'' And lost in the swirl of anxiety are the benefits that the change will bring to tens of millions of consumers. Americans alone are expected to save an estimated $6 billion in lower-cost goods once the quotas are gone, allowing clothing makers and designers from New York to Milan the freedom to choose factories based on cost and quality rather than a complicated system of 1,300 categories for every nation. But that is little consolation to this Carolina community of 36,000, which was reduced to an economic ghost town in little more than a year once Pillowtex, Ms. Harrington's former employer, fell into bankruptcy. The residents have remained, but the factories are being dismantled and the stores and shops shuttered on Main Street after this one-industry town lost its industry. ''I think the middle class is pretty much gone here,'' Ms. Harrington said as she cleared tables in the classic cafe of black-and-white-tile floor and red leather booths. ''In one year our receipts in the cafe have been cut in half. People are starting to lose their unemployment benefits, and then there will be nothing left.'' She had to compete for a job against more than 4,000 other workers who lost work when the mills that once made Cannon towels and sheets closed in July 2003. While American consumers' household budgets will benefit from lower prices for blouses and pillowcases, the shock to the affected workers and communities will be immediate and gut-wrenching. ''The end of the textile quotas will act like the tipping point on trade,'' said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International in New York. ''If we want to continue to enjoy public support toward moving toward more open trade, we have to do a lot more to help people dislocated by trade.'' Dislocation is an understatement for what has happened to the people in this town. ''For generations, everyone worked in textiles -- your mama or your daddy or your granddaddy,'' said Audrey Beaver, whose mother worked at the old Cannon mills until the bitter end. Kannapolis grew up around the mills built in 1906 by James William Cannon. Identical row houses line the streets radiating from the empty factories that once employed 20,000. The cold smokestacks still rise above the town, but teams of machines and men in hard hats are tearing down the mills, with the machinery, scrap wood and metal being sold to the highest bidders. Despite the grim employment picture, families have refused to move away from aging parents or new grandchildren. So fathers and mothers are searching for jobs in Charlotte and Greensboro, growing white-collar cities with service industries, and accepting long commuting times. The United States, unlike other wealthy nations, provides little support for companies and workers who lose out in the global marketplace. Current trade adjustment assistance, largely aimed at training workers for new jobs, was denounced by factory owners and union officials in this region as too little and too difficult. ''The high-tech jobs never came to our town,'' said Delores Gambrell, 52, who is a former union organizer at the mill, ''and the only good jobs are going to young people under 45 years of age. We've had to refinance our home. We're penny-pinching as much as we can, and I still don't know if we'll make it.'' Her family's savings are gone and so, too, are the college plans of her youngest son, who was the first in the family to win acceptance at the University of North Carolina. Union members and managers who were at each other's throats over organizing drives now agree that their common enemy is whichever administration is in Washington. In their opinion, neither President Bill Clinton nor President Bush fully understood the effect trade agreements would have on American industry. ''All I hear from Washington is that trade is a win-win proposition,'' said John A. Emrich, chief executive of Guilford Mills in Greensboro. ''Then I look at our growing trade deficit and think about the 3,400 good people in our good factories that we had to let go, and I want someone to show me where we have won. We're talked to by Washington as if we hadn't a brain in our heads.'' To stay afloat, Mr. Emrich shut seven factories and shifted the emphasis from producing apparel to making fabric for automobiles and for technical uses. His company's revenue fell to $500 million last year from $900 million in 1997. During the presidential debates, trade was barely mentioned, but it is a major topic in the closely fought Senate race in North Carolina. Erskine B. Bowles, the Democratic candidate, is the husband of Crandall C. Bowles, chief executive of Springs Industries, a surviving Carolina household textile company. He jokes in his stump speeches that he ''sleeps with the industry'' and then promises to fight against the full lifting of quotas to save jobs and factories. ''We have to start enforcing the trade deals we've signed before we negotiate any new ones,'' Mr. Bowles said at a visit to Guilford Technical Community College in Jamestown, N.C. ''We've lost too many jobs already.'' His Republican opponent, Representative Richard M. Burr, is just as vocal about the pitfalls of trade agreements for the textile industry. But he argues that he has a proven record of voting against deals with China while Mr. Bowles, as chief of staff for President Clinton, promoted them. While such political arguments go on in the cities and towns of North Carolina, a dozen poor Asian and Pacific nations are pressing for tariff legislation in Congress that would offer them some support. ''This is a very crucial moment for us,'' said Roland Eng, Cambodia's ambassador to the United States. ''If we lose half of our share of the U.S. market to China, it will have a cascading effect on our economy and we would be on the brink of devastation again.'' His fears are not exaggerated. By the end of 2005, according to a World Bank study, China is expected to control 47 percent of the world's apparel market. But economists argue that ultimately, the elimination of quotas will advance global growth. ''The textile quota system violated all the principles of trade that prohibits discrimination against suppliers,'' said Will Martin, lead economist of the development research group at the World Bank. ''If you want a market economy, you have to allow things to change. Textiles moved from England to New England and to the Carolinas. It's hard to blame China for using the same market forces to build its own industry.'' Some residents of Kannapolis have accepted the end of their textile industry and are looking to the popularity of stock-car racing for redemption. The town has built the Dale Earnhardt Plaza to celebrate its native son and has erected a statue of him that stands sentry over the doomed factories. ''Now the only people visiting here come to look at the Dale Earnhardt statue,'' Ms. Beaver said. But then, fondly recalling the son of the mill's founder, she added: ''I think it should have been a statue of Charlie Cannon. Charlie's the one who built up the mill and gave us jobs and houses, not Dale. It's not Charlie's fault what's happening now.''

Ra\u00fal Mu\u00f1oz Leos, a longtime chemical industry executive, was brought in as director general of Pemex four years ago by President Vicente Fox to instill a sense of private-sector efficiency in the company, one of the top 10-largest oil producers in the world. The Energy Ministry said Mr. Mu\u00f1oz would be succeeded by Pemex's head of exploration and production, Luis Ram\u00edrez Corzo. In a brief statement, the energy ministry said that the change was being made because of ''the current circumstances and future perspectives'' at the company, and its purpose was to ''strengthen the leadership the company needs'' in the last two years of Mr. Fox's government. Mr. Mu\u00f1oz has been under fire since newspapers disclosed the July deal with the company's union, which has nearly 100,000 members. Mr. Mu\u00f1oz signed the agreement without the backing of the Pemex board. Mr. Mu\u00f1oz said commitments made by earlier administrations were included in the agreement, which will pay for medical care, housing loans, sports facilities and events for the union. The furor echoed a scandal in which the Pemex union was accused of diverting at least $50 million to the presidential election campaign of Francisco Labastida, the losing candidate of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in 2000. A former head of Pemex was extradited from the United States last month to face charges related to the scandal. Among the strongest of Mr. Mu\u00f1oz's critics over the union payment was Mexico's finance minister, Francisco Gil D\u00edaz. Mexico's treasury depends on Pemex, which pays some 60 percent of its revenue in taxes, for about a third of its revenue. Mr. Mu\u00f1oz was further embarrassed last month when a newspaper disclosed that Pemex had paid for his wife's liposuction, although he eventually reimbursed the company. ''It's clear that to be head of Pemex you need to have more than business skills,'' said George Baker, director of Mexico Energy Intelligence, an industry newsletter based in Houston. ''You need to have body armor built into your professional training to deal with the politics that go into the job. Or you need strong support from the president.'' Mr. Mu\u00f1oz's resignation showed that he had neither, Mr. Baker said. Mr. Ram\u00edrez Corzo is a former academic and private-sector energy consultant who was appointed by Mr. Mu\u00f1oz in 2001. He has been at the forefront of some controversial company projects, including the effort to attract private-sector companies to develop Mexico's natural gas reserves. Mr. Mu\u00f1oz presided over growing investment -- some $12 billion this year -- aimed at raising output by Pemex. Pemex produces 3.4 million barrels of oil a day and exports 1.89 million barrels, mostly to the United States. Mexico is one of the top four oil suppliers to the United States. The company faces declining production in the next year or so as output at its primary Cantarell field peaks and begins to drop, said Jed Bailey, director of research for Latin America at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.", "title": "Leader of Mexican Energy Monopoly Resigns"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/Business", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Mexico", "Top/News", "Top/News/World/Americas", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/Mexico"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Business", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Business/Financial Desk", "print_page_number": "2", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "C", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/business/02pemex.html", "print_column": "4", "slug": "02PEME$02"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "HSBC is emerging from the shadow of Citigroup. Like Citigroup, HSBC is a global consumer and commercial banking giant. But while Citigroup has had a series of regulatory setbacks, resulting in the ouster last month of three top executives in the aftermath of the shutdown of its private banking operations in Japan, HSBC, with a strong, long-established franchise in Asia, has been running smoothly on all cylinders. HSBC's stock price and earnings growth have outpaced Citigroup's in the last year. Still, HSBC wants to expand in a business where it has been dwarfed by Citigroup -- investment banking. In the last two years, despite fierce competition and a lackluster market for deals, HSBC has been spending millions to hire bankers and build its merger and acquisition advisory business. That strategy is a shift for HSBC. For years, its chairman, Sir John Bond, shunned the high corporate salaries commanded by the bankers specializing in these businesses and criticized the aggressive culture that came with them. Now the strategy may be bearing fruit. HSBC recently scored its first big investment banking victory when it was named an adviser on a deal involving two big South African mining companies, Harmony Gold's $8.2 billion hostile bid for Gold Fields. But partly because HSBC does not have a big enough operation to sell the deal to investors in the United States, Merrill Lynch was brought in as another adviser. Last week, Harmony hired yet another adviser, Morgan Stanley. Some bankers in London said some Harmony executives were concerned that HSBC did not have enough deal experience. Harmony Gold's all-stock bid could be a tough sale. It is being fought by Gold Fields and it has been criticized by some Harmony shareholders, putting HSBC in just the type of pressure cooker situation that Sir John has generally tried to avoid. The banker hired by Sir John to build HSBC's deal-making business is no stranger to pressure. John J. Studzinski, a former Morgan Stanley banker, was hired in 2002, with a mandate to bring in enough bankers to create a deal-making dynamo. Mr. Studzinski, 48, came to London from the United States two decades ago and he made his reputation at Morgan Stanley as an adviser on deals like Unilever's successful $24.7 billion battle for Best Foods. Mr. Studzinski is well known for his donations to charity, his work with the homeless and his acquaintances with royalty and pop stars. He brought his preference for traveling to work in a chauffer-driven sports utility vehicle with him from Morgan Stanley, a vivid contrast with HSBC's longstanding culture of thrift. Sir John travels economy class on short flights and requires his employees to do the same. When it hired Mr. Studzinski, HSBC appointed a veteran to be co-head of investment and corporate banking. Stuart Gulliver, 45, built up the bank's highly successful Asian trading operations before being called back to London. Colleagues and former employees call him the quintessential trader, with sharp wits and an equally sharp tongue. The unlikely pair have bypassed some of the typical pitfalls of sharing a top job by splitting their responsibilities, colleagues said. Mr. Studzinski is responsible for corporate and investment banking and Mr. Gulliver for setting up the equities and trading departments. Together, they have hired 700 bankers, and fired another 700, spending more than $400 million to build HSBC's investment banking business. So far, it is hard to see major progress. HSBC is making some gains in global underwriting and ranks No.14 to date this year, up from No.16 in 2002, according to Thomson Financial. Corporate and investment banking, which includes an already strong trading arm, debt issuance and transaction banking, accounted for about 27 percent of HSBC's first-half 2004 profits, bringing in $2.76 billion. That is up 27 percent from a year earlier, but much of that increase came from longstanding derivatives and foreign exchange operations. HSBC has advised on $18.3 billion in completed deals in the first three quarters of 2004, putting the bank at No.24 globally, down from No.16 a year ago. Mr. Studzinski and Mr. Gulliver declined requests for interviews. The company's investment banking plans are part of a three- to five-year strategy, said a spokesman, who added that they should be evaluated as such, rather than this early in the game. Rival bankers are happy to note that despite Mr. Studzinski's renown and his connections, HSBC has so far not won huge debt, equity and merger deals. HSBC dabbled in investment banking before, but when big bonuses were not forthcoming, its bankers left. Sir John has told investors and journalists several times in the last year that he thinks there is a role for a bank that is providing straightforward advice. Some experts say SBC's underlying strategic shift is sound. ''If you want to play with major corporate customers, I don't know how you do it without'' having an investment bank, said H. Rodgin Cohen, chairman of the Wall Street law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell. Some investors still question the way the bank is approaching the business, and its commitment in the long term. ''You would look for an acquisition if you really want to get into that space,'' said Guy de Blonay, fund manager at New Star Asset Management, which has $100 million in global financial funds under management. A big investment banking acquisition is one thing that HSBC executives, including Sir John, swear they will not do. Stephen Green, HSBC's chief executive, said on Oct. 6 that HSBC does ''not need to make an investment banking acquisition to put ourselves into a highly competitive position with our clients.'' His remarks came after the share price of Bear Stearns rose for several days on rumors that HSBC could be a buyer. Merrill Lynch was also considered a possible match because of the strength of its United States brokerage business. UBS was mentioned because it could be a better cultural fit than an American investment bank. It is a tough time to try to become an investment bank, particularly in London, where most of Europe's financial transactions are conducted. About 10 big American and European investment banks are vying for the top spots, as well as small boutiques like Cazenove and Rothschild. ''Fees are going down, margins are going down, none of the eight top banks are quitting, and HSBC is saying 'We want to have a top-ranked investment banking franchise,''' a rival London banker said. ''They picked a bad time to decide this.'' Marc Thomas, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in London, said: ''On the debt side, there's no doubt, with HSBC's corporate relations and balance sheet, it could work exceptionally. On the equity side, you have to ask if they have the advantage.'' HSBC has won some deals besides the Harmony transaction. In June, HSBC was co-manager of the 16.5 billion Hong Kong dollar ($2.1 billion) initial public offering of Ping An Insurance of China; HSBC owned a minority stake in the company. In September, HSBC was co-manager of a $1.5 billion bond sale for Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, Mexico's state-owned oil company. It is currently a co-adviser to the French food company Picard Surgeles, which is selling itself in an auction. But HSBC's long history of corporate banking got in the way of at least one other transaction. Mr. Studzinski was eager to negotiate Philip Green's planned takeover of the British retailer Marks & Spencer, but Sir John rejected the idea because HSBC is a lender to Marks & Spencer, Mr. Green said. The entrepreneur, who ultimately did not win Marks & Spencer, said that experience did not mean that he would not call on HSBC for a deal in the future. ''They're interested in doing business with us, and we're interested in doing business with them,'' Mr. Green said. ''They've got a big balance sheet, and they're a big bank. You'd be crazy to ignore them.''

Over the weekend, people in some polling places had to stand in line for four, five, even six hours, often in the hot sun. Some of them -- African-Americans in particular -- surely suspected that those lines were so long because officials wanted to make it hard for them to vote. Yet they refused to be discouraged or intimidated. Here's what a correspondent from Florida wrote to Joshua Marshall, of talkingpointsmemo.com: ''To see people coming out -- elderly, disabled, blind, poor; people who have to hitch rides, take buses, etc. -- and then staying in line for hours and hours and hours Well, it's humbling. And it's awesome. And it's kind of beautiful.'' Yes, it is. I always get a little choked up when I go to the local school to cast my vote. The humbleness of the surroundings only emphasizes the majesty of the process: this is democracy, America's great gift to the world, in action. But over the last few days I've been seeing pictures from Florida that are even more majestic. They show long lines of voters, snaking through buildings and on down the sidewalk: citizens patiently waiting to do their civic duty. Those people still believe in American democracy; and because they do, so do I. In truth, I wasn't sure what would happen in Florida this year. After all that has gone wrong with voting in that state, it seemed all too possible that many people would simply give up and stay home. But it's already clear that the people of Florida -- and, I believe, America as a whole -- have refused to give in to cynicism and spin. Far from being discouraged by what happened in 2000, they seem to realize more than ever -- and better than those of us in the chattering classes -- what a precious thing the right to vote really is. And they are determined to exercise that right. And it's not just in Florida. Similar stories are coming in from across the country, wherever early voting is allowed: everywhere, huge numbers of voters are coming to the polls, determined to exercise their democratic rights. Of course, most Americans won't get their chance to vote until today, but I have no doubt that they will turn out in record numbers. I don't think the rain that will blanket some parts of the country will deter them. Regardless of their politics, most Americans understand that this is a crucial election, and that never before has their vote mattered so much for the nation's destiny. The talking heads on TV will no doubt frame all of this in partisan terms: light turnout favors one party, heavy turnout favors the other. True enough. But this isn't a zero-sum game: the more people vote, the more vital is our democracy. By coming to the polls, citizens are literally giving a vote of confidence in American democracy. And in so doing, they are proving themselves wiser than some of those they elected. Those who govern us seem to have learned little from the 2000 electoral debacle: voting machines are still unreliable, voting officials are still unforgivably partisan. But the public seems to have learned a lesson. Instead of becoming cynical, people seem to have become motivated. After an election in which a few hundred votes determined the fate of the nation, after four years of an administration that has demonstrated, for good or ill, that it matters a lot who becomes president, citizens know that their votes matter. And they are determined to cast those votes. What will happen when they do cast those votes? I don't know; neither does anyone else. That's how democracy works. Regular readers won't be in any doubt about who I want to win, though New York Times rules prevent me from giving any explicit endorsement. (Hint: it's the side that benefits from large turnout.) Above all, though, I want to see democracy vindicated, and the stain of 2000 eradicated, by a clean election in which as many people as possible get to cast their votes, and have those votes counted. And all the evidence says that's what the American people want, too. May all of us get our wish.

In a summation that relied heavily on photographs and audio tapes, Rick Distaso, the senior deputy district attorney of Stanislaus County, urged jurors to use common sense in analyzing the mostly circumstantial evidence against Mr. Peterson, who has been charged with the murder of his wife, Laci Peterson, and her fetus, whom the couple had planned to name Conner. He could face the death penalty if convicted. Mr. Distaso outlined Mr. Peterson's motive for murder and suggested that the defendant had the murder in mind at least a month before Ms. Peterson disappeared. ''He didn't want that dull married life,'' Mr. Distaso said. ''He did not want that baby. The reason he killed Laci Peterson was because Conner was on the way.'' Mr. Distaso presented a pictorial account of how he believed Mr. Peterson killed his wife in December 2002. To start, he projected a large photograph of Ms. Peterson on the wall across from the jury box. ''The defendant strangled or smothered Laci Peterson on the night of Dec. 23 or in the morning when she was getting dressed,'' Mr. Distaso said. Mr. Peterson then wrapped his wife's body in a blue tarp, placed it in his truck, then weighted the body and dumped it into San Francisco Bay, the prosecutor told the jury. Mr. Distaso showed jurors aerial photographs of the spot where Mr. Peterson said he went fishing on Dec. 24, 2002, an area so far offshore no one could have seen a body being dumped, he said. Then jurors were shown a photograph of a spot not far away where the remains washed ashore in April 2003. Mr. Peterson is the only person ''we know without any doubt that was in the exact location in the exact spot where Laci and Conner washed ashore,'' the prosecutor said. ''That alone is proof beyond a reasonable doubt in this case,'' Mr. Distaso said. ''You can take that fact to the bank and you can convict this man of murder.'' Much of Mr. Distaso's closing argument centered around tying up loose ends, giving details of what he called a long list of lies the defendant told to friends, family members, the police and his girlfriend, Amber Frey. Mr. Distaso suggested that Ms. Frey represented the life of freedom Mr. Peterson so coveted. Citing photographs, taped telephone conversations and other evidence, he argued that Mr. Peterson was living a double life: the life of the devoted and grieving husband and that of a carefree playboy. The defense, which is scheduled to deliver its closing argument Tuesday, has argued that Ms. Peterson was abducted by strangers and then killed, possibly for money.", "title": "Prosecutor Tells Jury Peterson Killed Wife to Live a Fantasy"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/U.S.", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/California", "Top/News/U.S./West", "Top/News", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/California"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "U.S.", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "National Desk", "print_page_number": "21", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/national/02peterson.html", "print_column": "3", "slug": "02PETE$03"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "The two biggest question marks for the Nets, as they head into their season opener against Shaquille O'Neal and the Miami Heat on Wednesday night, are rebounding and the void left at point guard by the injured Jason Kidd. At least that is what Ed Stefanski, the general manager of the Nets, says. Kidd, who had surgery on his left knee on July 1, will probably not be ready to return until December or January at the earliest. He received clearance Wednesday to begin the oncourt phase of his rehabilitation. ''I think time will only tell,'' Stefanski said of Kidd's status. ''Everything will evolve. We expect him, when he's healthy, to be back on the court for us.'' Alonzo Mourning is returning, having recovered from a kidney transplant on Dec. 19. Mourning, 34, played just 12 regular-season games the last two seasons. He played Thursday, in his first game since Nov. 22, contributing 12 points, 5 rebounds and 2 blocked shots in 19 minutes in a preseason victory over Philadelphia. Mourning has captured the imagination of the franchise and its dwindling fan base with his determination to get back on the court. But he said last week that his desire to remain with the franchise depended on what happened with Kidd. ''I'm trying to help this ball club win while I'm here,'' he said Friday. Mourning's four-year, $22.6 million contract is guaranteed but not insured, making him virtually untradable because of health concerns. ''And if Zo can play for us, then the rebounding question doesn't become a question mark for us,'' Stefanski said, referring to Mourning. Shooting guard does not seem to be a question for Coach Lawrence Frank, at least not if Ron Mercer and Rodney Buford, who signed as free agents in the off-season, can duplicate their preseason success. Small forward remains a strength. The Nets return their leading scorer from last season, Richard Jefferson, who averaged 18.5 points a game. The Nets do not have an answer at power forward, however, now that Kenyon Martin is gone. In a series of cost-cutting moves, the Nets traded Martin, their most important big man, to Denver. They also shipped their longtime shooting guard Kerry Kittles to the Los Angeles Clippers. And the Nets chose not to bring back Rodney Rogers and Lucious Harris, who had been key reserves. ''Obviously, on paper, when you lose a player the magnitude of Kenyon, it's going to hurt,'' Stefanski said. ''You have to do something to try to solve that problem.'' Eric Williams, another free-agent signee, will probably start at power forward, with Brian Scalabrine and Aaron Williams coming off the bench. Jason Collins, 7-footer, returns to start at center. He can also move to power forward when Mourning is on the court. At point guard, Zoran Planinic will rotate with Jacque Vaughn and Travis Best, who signed as free agents in the off-season, until Kidd returns. ''The health factor of Zo and Jason Kidd are huge for us,'' Stefanski said. ''With both of them in our lineup, I won't be afraid to play other teams in the N.B.A. with that team.''

Beyond praising Bush, has King done his financial part for the re-election of Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney? In June 2003, King, a fight promoter, gave $2,000 to Bush and donated $42,500 to the Republican National Committee and $5,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee. But he also threw $2,000 into the failed Democratic presidential primary campaigns of Richard A. Gephardt and Carol Moseley Braun. He did not donate a dollar to the campaign of Senator John F. Kerry, the Democratic nominee. Meanwhile, Bob Arum, the best-known boxing promoter this side of King, did not provide a pro-Kerry counterbalance; he also gave $2,000 to Bush. Don King Productions, King's promotional firm, ranked in the top five among sports-related companies in political donations to candidates for federal office during the 2003-4 election cycle, according to opensecrets.org, a Web site created by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Leading the list was Major League Baseball, with $300,116 distributed by its political action committee to various candidates, party committees and PAC's. It was followed by International Speedway ($112,096) and the National Basketball Association ($111,300). The largest individual beneficiaries of Major League Baseball's largess in Congress, at $10,000 each, were three Republicans: Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which has oversight over baseball's antitrust exemption; Sen. Jim Bunning of Kentucky, who threw a perfect game against the Mets 40 years ago; and House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois. Commissioner Bud Selig contributed $250 to Sensenbrenner, according to opensecrets.org and the Federal Election Commission. Paul Tagliabue, the N.F.L. commissioner, gave $2,000 to the Bush-Cheney campaign and $1,000 to Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut in his failed effort to win the Democratic presidential nomination. David Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, was a lavish pro-Democratic contributor, giving $2,000 to the Kerry-John Edwards campaign, $25,000 to the Kerry Victory 2004 committee and $32,500 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, gave $2,000 to the president, but also $2,000 to Senator Bob Graham of Florida, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination. Steinbrenner's son, Hal, gave $5,000 to the Republican National Committee. Steinbrenner's nemeses with the Boston Red Sox -- the principal owner John W. Henry and the part owner Tom Werner -- contributed $2,000 apiece to Kerry, a Massachusetts senator. They, along with General Manager Theo Epstein, campaigned with Kerry on Sunday in Manchester, N.H. Charles Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision, which owns the Knicks and Rangers, gave $2,000 to Bush and Kerry, as did his son, James, the Cablevision president, who oversees the teams and Madison Square Garden. Charles Dolan gave $25,000 to the Republican National Committee, and his son gave $5,000 to the Democratic National Committee. Fred Wilpon, the Mets' principal owner, gave Bush $2,000, but his son, Jeff, the team's chief operating officer, gave $2,000 to Bush and Kerry. (The former co-owner of the Mets, Nelson Doubleday, gave the Republican National Committee $2,000.) Jeff Vanderbeek, the investment banker turned owner of the Devils, gave $8,000 to two Bush-Cheney committees, while the former owner, John J. McMullen, gave $25,000 to Kerry Victory 2004. Bruce C. Ratner, the Nets' owner, had no contributions listed, but Charles Kushner, who bid against him for the team (and recently pleaded guilty to attempting to compromise a witness in a campaign-finance investigation), gave $52,500 to the Democratic party, and $2,000 to Lieberman. Woody Johnson, the Jets' owner and a longtime Bush backer, gave $25,000 to the Republican National Committee. Wellington Mara of the Giants gave $2,000 to Bush, and Bob Tisch, the co-owner, gave $2,000 to Kerry and Bush. In sports television, the Bush-Cheney campaign received $2,000 apiece from Sean McManus, the president of CBS Sports; George Bodenheimer, the president of ESPN and ABC Sports; and Steve Bornstein, the president of the NFL Network. Among sportscasters, Jim Nantz, Al Michaels and Pat Summerall each gave $2,000 to Bush, and Troy Aikman gave Bush $8,000.

The problems came as elections officials made last-minute preparations for what could be a huge turnout as voters prepared to cast their ballots in today's presidential election. More than 400,000 people have been added to the more than 4 million people on the voting rolls in New York City, and the demand for information on polling sites is expected to be particularly high this year, after a redistricting two years ago that changed where many people must cast their ballots. Leaders of civic groups said they had received calls from voters complaining that they were unable to get information on where to vote, either by looking for polling sites through the Board of Election's Web site, www.vote.nyc.ny.us, or by calling the board at (866) VOTE-NYC. In an interview earlier yesterday, John Ravitz, the executive director of the New York City Board of Elections, said that the board had spent the last few months preparing for today's vote and that it had obtained more than 400 new voting machines from other states and modified them for today. ''We're prepared for a huge turnout,'' Mr. Ravitz said. ''There has been a huge voter registration drive in the city, not just by the various campaigns but by other groups. There have been a number of institutions and organizations involved. And we've been excited about the increase in voter registration.'' But later in the day, after it was clear that the board telephone lines and Web site were not functioning properly, calls to Mr. Ravitz's office did not go through. Repeated calls to the board throughout the afternoon were greeted with a busy signal or no were not answered. ''What we're seeing is a poor level of performance,'' said Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group, a student-led nonprofit organization that has ties to Ralph Nader. ''We have had a lot of complaints come into our office. And we ourselves have tried calling the board to get information without success.'' Mr. Russianoff said his office had been ''trying to reach the board since noon'' without success. While Mr. Ravitz forecasted that turnout might be higher this year in New York City, Lee Daghlian, a spokesman for the State Board of Elections, said he was less certain of higher turnout statewide. ''Turnout usually peaks for a presidential election, but I don't see any reason why it should be any higher than last time, when 62 percent of registered voters in New York came out,'' Mr. Daghlian said. ''I don't think the percentage will change a lot. Since everyone expects this to be a Kerry state, some people might not be as motivated to come out and vote.'' Meanwhile, the United State Senate race in New York finished up much like the way it played out over the last few months, with Senator Charles E. Schumer, the Democrat, campaigning on behalf of other candidates, and Assemblyman Howard D. Mills trying to draw attention to his long-shot bid. Mr. Mills, a Republican from Orange County, had some star power in his final push -- he flew to five stops along with Gov. George E. Pataki. But even there, Mr. Mills's campaign appeared to be an add-on as opposed to the central theme, as Mr. Pataki billed his statewide tour as a Bush-Cheney victory tour. Still, recent polls suggest that Mr. Mills would be able to secure at least a distant second-place finish. At one point he appeared to be battling the Conservative Party candidate, Dr. Marilyn O'Grady, for even that. ''We have had a great response as people finally focused on the race in the last week, and we think Howard will do surprisingly well,'' said Kevin Collins, campaign manager for Mr. Mills. Senator Schumer did go on the campaign trail yesterday. But as he did in most of his other campaign appearances, he was mostly stumping for other candidates. If there has been any controversy over Mr. Schumer's re-election bid, it has been over his refusal to commit to serving a full six years if re-elected and his unwillingness to say he would not run for governor in 2006. Mr. Schumer insists he is focused only on the Senate, but once again yesterday that focus was broadened to include Albany, the seat of state government. He was on Long Island asking voters to back two candidates for the State Legislature who have fashioned their candidacies around the notion that the state government needs to be fixed. ''We are glad we could run a positive campaign that talked about Chuck's record,'' said Stu Loeser, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer. In addition to the Senate race, the entire state legislature is up for re-election in New York state, and there are several competitive Congressional races in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.", "title": "Where to Vote in New York?

The presidential candidates are finally finished campaigning here, and up to two million of the state's 10.3 million voters have made their choices through early voting. So is Florida ready? Accusations and disclosures continued to surface even on Monday, suggesting that absent a landslide winner, Election Day and its aftermath will be messy here, just as it was in 2000. Republican lawyers said they had identified 1,700 felons who had not received clemency yet were illegally registered to vote. Republican poll watchers have each felon's photograph and criminal record, the lawyers said, so they can mount legal challenges should any try to vote. Gov. Jeb Bush said in Jacksonville, ''I don't think you're going to see a lot of challenges at the polls.'' He also predicted that President Bush, his brother, would carry Florida by four percentage points. In Palm Beach County, voting rights groups sued the elections supervisor, Theresa LePore, after learning that she had banned reporters and others from talking to voters outside polling places. A freelance journalist was arrested on Sunday and charged with disorderly conduct after photographing people waiting to vote outside Ms. LePore's office. ''Subverting the Constitution in order to bully and arrest journalists or poll monitors whose purpose is to ensure a fair and democratic electoral process should not be tolerated,'' said Elliot M. Mincberg, general counsel for the People for the American Way Foundation, which says it fights for ''legal and social justice progress.'' Ms. LePore said she issued the rule last week because people felt harassed by reporters and others who approached them in long early voting lines. Mr. Mincberg said state law let people talk to voters at least 50 feet from a polling place. If nothing else, Floridians are more than ready to put the anticipatory stage behind them and face whatever comes next. Those who waited through days of grim prediction for recent hurricanes are experiencing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and looking forward to the recovery stage. But given the apparent closeness of the race, the partisan rancor and the complex procedures and machinery that will be used for the first time in a presidential election, no one has a clue how Florida will fare. ''There are so many imponderables,'' said Donald Jaffin, a Republican and retired lawyer who was watching the Palm Beach County Elections Canvassing Commission inspect boxloads of absentee ballots on Monday. ''I think the state is doing their very best, and I have confidence in the governor. But we've never faced anything like this.'' Voting rights groups are especially nervous about potential eligibility challenges, which they said could delay and wrongly disenfranchise voters. An obscure state law enacted more than a century ago allows such challenges, but has rarely been used. Secretary of State Glenda E. Hood issued guidelines for challenges last week, but voting rights groups said they were too vague. Challenged voters can be made to cast provisional ballots, which are not counted until eligibility is confirmed. Provisional ballots are cast on optical-scan machines with central tallying, and such machines had a high error rate in 2000. ''You may as well be handing them a punch-card ballot,'' said Lida Rodriguez-Taseff, chairwoman of the Miami-Dade Election Reform Coalition, a watchdog group. Like so many other disputed practices, provisional balloting did not exist here in 2000, when the problems leading to the protracted recount involved punch-card ballots and other methods that have been banned. Governor Bush has pointed to the overhaul of electoral practices as proof that things will go smoothly. But now, Ion Sancho, the Leon County elections supervisor, said, ''We have different kinds of problems.'' Mr. Sancho said the biggest challenge would be the enormous turnout, which some experts say could exceed 75 percent or even 80 percent of the registered voters. Early voters in Florida had to wait up to four hours to cast ballots, partly because counties did not provide enough polling places or machines to meet the demand. Mr. Sancho said he suspected that the lines were especially long in counties with touch-screen machines because the machines were expensive and the counties had bought too few. Ms. LePore of Palm Beach County said she expected much shorter lines on Tuesday, because far more polling places would be open. Her county had eight early voting sites and 692 regular places. Many fears focused on touch-screen machines, which studies show sometimes fail to record votes. Elections officials say that occurs only when a voter intentionally does not make a selection. Ms. Rodriguez-Taseff, a critic of the machines, said she had not heard of serious malfunctions in the early voting. There have been scattered, unconfirmed reports of machines that switched a voter's selection for president. Republicans sued in Broward County Circuit Court, saying the elections supervisor, Brenda L. Snipes, a Democrat whom Mr. Bush appointed, had not updated voting lists Monday night to include people who had voted early during the day. A senior Republican adviser, Mindy Tucker Fletcher, said the lack of updating left open a possibility that a person could vote again on Tuesday. Late Monday, Judge David Krathen denied the motion. Ms. Snipes agreed to update the list by 7 a.m. Broward County has more registered Democrats than any other Florida county. Asked whether Republicans had checked the other 66 counties, Ms. Fletcher said: ''We haven't had this problem in any other county. I assume if that happened anywhere else, we'd have a problem there, too.'' Broward County rushed out thousands of replacement absentee ballots last week after the originals never got to mailboxes. Elections supervisors begged voters to return them in person. Broward and Palm Beach Counties mailed thousands of absentee ballots on Saturday, but postal officials said they might be too late. In Duval County, a spokeswoman for the Elections Office said the Republicans had sent an overnight list of felons who might try to vote and their criminal records. She said the office would not refer to the list, because names cannot be purged from the rolls within 90 days of an election.

Rehnquist disclosed Monday that his thyroid cancer was being treated with both chemotherapy and radiation, and he did not return to work despite his previously announced plan to do so. A carefully worded statement released by his office shortly before the other eight justices began hearing arguments gave no indication when, or whether, the 80-year-old chief justice might return to the bench. That silence invited immediate speculation that he would soon retire. The doctors who are treating him have not made any public statements. But medical specialists not connected with his case said his course of treatment strongly suggested that he could be suffering from a rapidly progressive type of cancer that had already spread and might now be inoperable. This would make it unlikely that he could complete the court's current term. The statement was an extraordinary development in the closing hours of a presidential campaign in which partisans on both sides have tried to remind voters that the next president could well be in a position to reshape the Supreme Court. The court has gone without a vacancy for more than 10 years and is closely divided on many important issues. A bitter Supreme Court confirmation fight could serve to reinforce the political polarization that has characterized the presidential race. Chief Justice Rehnquist spent seven days at Bethesda Naval Hospital, returning home on Friday. While in the hospital, he underwent a tracheotomy to relieve breathing problems, but the clear implication of the statement was that the cancerous thyroid itself had not been removed. Removal of the thyroid is the usual treatment for the more common, readily curable form of thyroid cancer. While the chief justice gave no details on his type of cancer, doctors who are not involved in his treatment said the information that he did provide suggested that he might have the anaplastic type, which is typically fatal in a relatively short time. [Page A25.] In his statement, Chief Justice Rehnquist said he was recuperating at home and would have radiation and chemotherapy treatment on an outpatient basis. ''According to my doctors, my plan to return to the office today was too optimistic,'' he said. The Supreme Court's press office announced that plan last Monday, when it said that the chief justice ''underwent a tracheotomy on Saturday in connection with a recent diagnosis of thyroid cancer.'' While the court provided no other details at that time, cancer specialists said then that the tracheotomy indicated serious illness and made his speedy return to work unlikely. The latest statement, issued not by the press office but from the chief justice's chambers, concluded: ''While at home, I am working on court matters, including opinions for cases already argued. I am, and will continue to be, in close contact with my colleagues, my law clerks, and members of the Supreme Court staff.'' Justice John Paul Stevens, the senior associate justice, who presided over the court's proceedings on Monday, noted that the chief justice ''reserved the right'' to participate in cases by reading the briefs and the transcripts of the arguments. Justices occasionally vote in cases in which they have missed the argument, but typically do not. A 4-to-4 tied vote serves under the court's rules to affirm the lower court opinion without setting a precedent for other cases. Political analysts said Monday that the latest news about the chief justice would probably have little effect on the election because voters who care about the composition of the court had already made up their minds. The political ramifications of filling a vacancy on the court would depend in part on when it occurred. The picture could be tremendously complicated if a vacancy were to occur while it appeared that a contested election was heading once again for the Supreme Court. Todd F. Gaziano, director of the Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, said that if President Bush lost the election on Tuesday but the result was contested in the courts, Mr. Bush would ''have the responsibility to consider'' making a recess appointment to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. Such an appointee could serve without Senate approval until the end of the first session of the new Congress in late 2005. After the 2000 election, President Bill Clinton used his constitutional authority to make recess appointments to place Roger L. Gregory on the federal appeals court in Richmond, Va. The Senate later confirmed Judge Gregory to a lifetime position. President Eisenhower used recess appointments to place three justices on the Supreme Court: Earl Warren as chief justice and Potter Stewart and William J. Brennan Jr. as associate justices. The Senate then confirmed all three. However, the political climate now is very different, and Democrats said Monday that a recess appointment by a lame-duck President Bush would be politically unthinkable. John Podesta, chief of staff in the Clinton administration and now president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group, dismissed the idea as a preposterously ''in your face'' maneuver. Any Supreme Court vacancy that occurred soon could become the vehicle for the bitter campaign of 2004 to perpetuate itself, even if the election outcome is clear. Mr. Podesta said that if the Senate remained as closely divided as it is now, ''neither party will be in a strong position to push through a nominee.'' He predicted that given the divisiveness of the presidential campaign, Senator John Kerry, if elected, would use a vacancy to send a signal that he intended ''to bring the country together back toward the center'' while Mr. Bush would try to use a vacancy as ''pay back'' to satisfy his conservative supporters. Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, said that a President Kerry would ''have some difficulty'' with his nominees if the Senate remained Republican. Kerry nominees ''won't be pro-life and they won't be pro-traditional marriage,'' Mr. Perkins said, adding that ''you will see a strong battle waged on both sides'' because ''people realize what is at stake and neither side will relent in their efforts to see that their issues are guarded.'' The leaders of two liberal groups, Nan Aron of the Alliance for Justice and Ralph Neas of People for the American Way, both said that animosity between Mr. Bush and the Democrats predated the presidential campaign because of fights over lower-court nominations and agreed that the election would only have worsened the situation. Ms. Aron added that those fights had only primed Senate Democrats for battle. Any president faced with a vacancy for chief justice must decide whether to choose someone from outside the court or to elevate an associate justice, which gives him the chance to pick two nominees but also requires two confirmation efforts. William Rehnquist faced a prolonged debate when President Ronald Reagan nominated him in 1986 for elevation to chief justice to replace Warren E. Burger. He was confirmed by a vote of 65 to 33, not much different from the 68-to-26 vote by which he was confirmed as President Richard M. Nixon's nominee to the court in 1971.", "title": "Rehnquist Fails to Return, And Speculation Increases"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/U.S.", "Top/News", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Cancer", "Top/News/Front Page"], "publication_day_of_month": "2", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Front Page; U.S.", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "National Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Tuesday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/politics/02rehnquist.html", "print_column": "5", "slug": "02REHN$07"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Legions of get-out-the-vote volunteers, the bloodhounds of democracy, pursued the electorate across a dozen states yesterday as the most expensive and successful voter drive in history drew to a resounding close with experts predicting a record turnout at the polls today. With the excitement of the campaign at a fever pitch and voters so polarized there was almost no one left to convert, nonpartisan election experts said that as many as 121 million Americans might vote, eclipsing the record of 106 million of four years ago. And with the race too close to call, the winner is likely to be the side best able to muster its core supporters, party strategists agreed. On the last day of his two-year campaign for the presidency, Senator John Kerry dashed from Florida to Wisconsin and across the Great Lakes to Michigan and Ohio, basking in the glow of enthusiastic crowds. President Bush, fighting to hold on to the White House, also campaigned across the nation, logging 2,548 miles before heading to his Texas ranch. [Page A23.] As the match went down to the wire, the volunteer armies in Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and other swing states pounded on doors, rang telephones, stuffed computers and mailboxes and arranged Election Day enticements: free day care for parents, free rides to polling places for elderly or disabled voters, free cookies, tacos, T-shirts and admissions to swimming pools. Even free underwear. Many employers are giving workers time off to vote; one in New York is offering an extra vacation day as a reward for voting. A Pennsylvania professor is giving students extra credit for casting a ballot, and one in New Jersey was reported to have spoken about making voting a requirement for passing her course. If it rains in Cleveland today, volunteers will stand in lines with umbrellas and ponchos to keep voters dry. Most but not all of the volunteers are working for Kerry or Bush victories. But in New Mexico, the Election Protection Coalition, a national, nominally nonpartisan group, deployed hundreds of volunteers in Albuquerque, Santa Fe and other cities to help voters who are often underrepresented -- Hispanics, who make up 42 percent of the 1.8 million New Mexicans, and American Indians, who constitute 10 percent. Lara Jirmanus, legal coordinator for the Albuquerque coalition, said ''inviting people to the polls who haven't felt invited in the past'' was the intent. Four years ago, Al Gore won in New Mexico by 366 votes. The national drive to raise voter participation this year had little to do with civic duty. It was promoted by the major parties and their allies in part by the razor-thin margin in 2000, when Mr. Bush lost the popular vote by half a million ballots but won the election by five electoral votes after a recount fight that went to the Supreme Court. It put Florida in the Bush column by 537 votes out of six million cast. Nationally, the Democrats and the Republicans each claimed to have a million volunteers. Democrats said they had made 23.5 million calls and knocked on eight million doors for Mr. Kerry. Republicans said they had contacted 18 million voters. The numbers were impossible to verify, but there was no doubt they were huge. Voters were besieged by recorded calls from candidates, their wives or star supporters. Many voters were contacted by both sides, sometimes minutes apart. Yesterday, the Kerry forces in Cleveland spoke of a simple Election Day strategy: grab as many people as possible and get them to the polls. ''It's every single person on the streets, every household,'' said Charlene Sinclair, an organizer for Acorn, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, an independent group working for Mr. Bush's defeat. Ms. Sinclair said dozens of rented vans would be used to search for eligible voters. Republicans in Cleveland planned a highly choreographed ''knock and drag'' effort by 10,000 Cuyahoga County volunteers. ''You have to pull them out of their houses and get them into a car and get them to the polls,'' Jeff Flint, a Republican Party spokesman, explained. Volunteers themselves will be tracked and prodded, if need be, by roving supervisors, he said. Kerry campaign offices in Milwaukee were beehives of activity. Hundreds of volunteers, many from states where the race was not close, moved out in shifts to knock on doors and deliver talks and literature geared to specific types of voters: old or young, newly registered or old guard. The Democrats, too, will mount ''knock and drag'' follow-ups. Both sides used automatic phone dialers in Milwaukee. At a Service Employees International Union office being used by the Kerry campaign, volunteers waited as the machines did the work. When a call was answered, a volunteer read a script about ''the need for change.'' Bush volunteers at another site had a script that said, ''You simply cannot trust John Kerry on the issues that face our country.'' In New Hampshire, Democrats and Republicans focused their forces in the populous southern cities of Manchester and Nashua and the coastal city of Portsmouth. ''We are just going full-throttle here,'' Jayne Millerick, the New Hampshire Republican chairwoman, said. ''We literally have hundreds of people on the street, knocking on doors and reminding people to vote tomorrow, and asking them to vote Republican. The phone banks are doing the same, and we're just going to continue to go until the polls close tomorrow.'' Kathleen Strand, chairwoman of the New Hampshire Democrats, said volunteers were giving special attention to colleges, including Dartmouth and the University of New Hampshire. ''It's absolutely essential we get students to the polls,'' she said. ''If Al Gore had won New Hampshire he'd be president today, and George Bush won by 1 percent of the vote. Every vote counts, every door knock matters, and there are 50,000 students in the state of New Hampshire.'' In Colorado, 60 volunteers canvassed low- and moderate-income Denver neighborhoods for Democrats who might need rides, especially those who rarely bothered to vote. ''These people tend to feel like their vote doesn't count,'' said Les Berry, 48, a technician at Denver International Airport who is taking three vacation days to help. In Minnesota, the Bush campaign claimed to have made more than a million ''voter contacts,'' with thousands of volunteers going door to door and making phone calls. The Kerry campaign headquarters in Minneapolis was bustling with volunteers working the phones, making signs in English and Spanish and crunching numbers on calculators. Others streamed in and out all day, pausing only when the movie actor Josh Hartnett stopped in briefly. ''You have really stepped up,'' Mr. Hartnett told the beaming volunteers. ''I know we're going to win.'' The task was partly completed in some states. In New Mexico, an estimated 42 percent of the 1.1 million registered voters had already cast ballots. In Iowa, election workers began opening outer envelopes containing 63,000 completed ballots -- double the number of early votes cast in 2000. They were to be counted today.

Backman played as if a pit bull were chasing him. He was all intensity, all the time. Backman will now try to transfer that intense style into resurrecting the Arizona Diamondbacks. He was named their manager yesterday. The 45-year-old Backman, who had briefly been a candidate for the Mets' job, received a two-year contract from the Diamondbacks, who had the worst record in the major leagues this year. Not surprising, the fiery Backman instantly tried to put his imprint on the team. It may be logical to assume that the Diamondbacks must rebuild after a dreadful 51-111 season, but Backman passed by that idea as if barreling over a catcher. ''The one thing that I would like to state, and then I'm kind of going to leave it at that, is this is not a rebuilding program,'' Backman said during a news conference in Phoenix. ''I'm here to win. And that's what I've always been about.'' Backman managed Arizona's Class A Lancaster team to an 86-54 record and into the California League championship this season; The Sporting News named him minor league manager of the year. He referred to his assertiveness often, and it will be intriguing to see how the team reacts to his approach. Before joining the Diamondbacks organization, he managed in the Chicago White Sox organization for three years. He seemed a solid candidate to replace Jerry Manuel in 2003, but the White Sox dismissed him for campaigning for the job while Manuel still had it. Backman has a 410-396 record in eight seasons as a minor league manager. The Mets planned to interview Backman in St. Louis last Wednesday, but he told them his flight from Phoenix was canceled so the interview was rescheduled for the next day. Backman then asked the Mets to remove him from consideration, a signal that he was in line for the Arizona job. ''He expects to win,'' Arizona General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said. ''We expect to win and his players will understand that from the first day of spring training.'' The Diamondbacks are eager for Backman to inject aggressiveness into a losing, lifeless team. Backman was suspended twice at Class A Lancaster, including 10 games for bumping an umpire, and was also ejected from six games. While Backman's passionate personality on the field was one of the reasons the Diamondbacks wanted him, it has apparently contributed to some embarrassment off the field. In the last four years, Backman has been arrested after a domestic dispute with his wife, Sandy, and for a drunken driving incident; and he has filed for bankruptcy. Backman was found guilty of driving under the influence on Jan. 3, 2001, in Kennewick, Wash. He spent one day in jail, was fined $560 and was ordered to complete a course on alcohol counseling. Nine months later, Backman was charged with five misdemeanors after an incident with his wife at their home in Prineville, Ore. Backman was convicted of one charge (harassment), was imprisoned for a day, was put on probation for 12 months, was prohibited from drinking alcohol and was told to enter an anger-control treatment program. He was also fined more than $1,000. In February 2003, Backman filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code, which allows debtors to free themselves of most of their debts. Backman, a second baseman, played the first 9 of his 14 seasons in the majors with the Mets and had a .275 lifetime average. A first-round draft pick in 1977, he batted .320 when the Mets won the World Series 18 years ago. Backman cited Davey Johnson, Jim Leyland and Lou Piniella, some of his former managers, as men whose ideas he had absorbed. ''My style is hard, aggressive baseball,'' he said. ''If my brother is the second baseman for the Los Angeles Dodgers and it means taking him out at second base, that's what I expect my players to do.'' INSIDE PITCH In an unexpected decision, Gerry Hunsicker of the Astros resigned yesterday as general manager. Hunsicker had been with Houston for nine seasons. The Astros ended the season one victory away from their first World Series. But Hunsicker explained that he had to get away from the daily baseball grind. Tim Purpura, an assistant general manager, replaced Hunsicker.

The report said that Caminiti died Oct. 10 in the Bronx of ''acute intoxication due to the combined effects of cocaine and opiates.'' An autopsy and tissue and toxicology tests were performed on Caminiti. Grace Brugess, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner, said the autopsy showed that coronary artery disease and an enlarged heart contributed to the death. She said that the overdose had weakened Caminiti's heart. Caminiti, 41, had admitted to using steroids during his 15-year career in the major leagues and to using cocaine in recent years. Five days before his death, he told a Houston court that he had tested positive for cocaine a month earlier, violating the terms of his probation. He failed a similar test in February 2002, also violating a probation. The Houston court sentenced him to 180 days in jail, but he was released because of time served in jail and in a state-run drug-treatment facility. He then traveled to New York to help a friend, his agent and lawyer, Rick Licht, said. Licht, speaking by telephone from his office in Los Angeles yesterday, said a former girlfriend of Caminiti's had asked him to help her son, who was in legal trouble. Caminiti went to their home in Brooklyn, Licht said, talked to the son, then went to an apartment in the Bronx. Later in the day, he collapsed there and was taken to a hospital in the Bronx, where he died. ''He led an extraordinary roller coaster of a life,'' Licht said. In an interview that appeared in Sports Illustrated in May 2002, Caminiti said that he started using anabolic steroids in 1996, to help him recover from a shoulder injury, and that he kept using them until he retired. A third baseman, he led the San Diego Padres to a division championship in 1996. That year, he was named M.V.P.; he batted .326 with 40 home runs and 130 runs batted in, all career bests. From 1987 through 2001, Caminiti played for the Houston Astros, San Diego, the Texas Rangers and the Atlanta Braves. A right-handed hitter, he had a career batting average of .272, with 239 home runs and 983 R.B.I. Several months after Sports Illustrated published Caminiti's remarks, baseball adopted a testing program for steroids.

But he would have to pay instead of play. Unfortunately, Ramirez has shown no inclination to do what would make him a hero to the young baseball players at George Washington High School in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. George Washington was Ramirez's high school, the place where he developed and showcased the talent that has made him one of the best hitters and highest-paid players in Major League Baseball. It is a relatively poor school that receives little money for the baseball team. Old uniforms and beaten-up baseballs are what the players often wear and use. With the kind of money Ramirez makes with the Red Sox, he could easily provide financial aid, but he never has. The commissioner's office lists Ramirez's 2004 salary as $20,409,542. Additional payments will bring his baseball income to about $21 million: bonuses of $150,000 for being the World Series M.V.P.; $75,000 for making the All-Star team; a $100,000 bonus for winning a Silver Slugger award, which is very likely; and $300,000 or more as a World Series share. For less than one-tenth of one percent of his income, between $10,000 and $20,000, Ramirez could enable his former team to have new uniforms, new baseballs, new bats. But the George Washington players should not sit around waiting for the contribution. ''Unfortunately, we keep waiting and hoping, but it doesn't happen,'' said Steve Mandl, the George Washington baseball coach now and when Ramirez played on the team from 1989 through 1991. ''He's sort of distancing himself more and more from the school, his community, his friends. He was an icon here. He has become just another superstar whom they like as opposed to the demigod he used to be.'' Mandl said somebody told him recently that Ramirez or an associate said that every time Ramirez comes to the neighborhood, people say, ''gimme, gimme, gimme.'' ''I can understand that,'' Mandl added, ''but I've never asked him for anything. The kids are of Dominican descent, same as he is. Their needs are the same as his were.'' On one or two occasions, Mandl acknowledged, one of his assistants, whom he described as being very close to Ramirez, asked him to pay for something for the team. ''He said, 'Yeah, go ahead and do it.' But we never got the money.'' It is, of course, no one else's business how Ramirez spends his money or to whom he gives or doesn't give some of it. His former agent, Jeff Moorad, now the chief executive of the Arizona Diamondbacks, has said that Ramirez is committed to giving $1 million over the life of his eight-year contract to Latino groups in the Boston area, particularly those that support children. Although Moorad has indicated that Ramirez would eventually do something for the players at George Washington, it hasn't happened. Efforts to elicit comment from Ramirez through the Red Sox' public relations director, Glenn Geffner, and the player's new agent, Scott Parker, were unsuccessful. When Ramirez was initially asked about the matter a couple of years ago, he refused to talk about it. ''I was talking to your old high school baseball coach,'' I began our brief conversation. ''I don't want to talk about that,'' Ramirez said without waiting to hear the question. ''Will you talk about your interest or noninterest in donating anything to the school?'' ''I don't want to talk about that,'' Ramirez said. ''Is that a sore subject with you?'' ''No. You want to talk about the game, I'll talk to you about the game.'' Someone had suggested that Ramirez had a problem with Mandl, so later in the conversation, I asked, ''Is there a problem that can be fixed?'' Ramirez said he didn't have a problem with anybody. ''With Steve Mandl?'' Ramirez repeated that he didn't have a problem with anybody. Many players give something back to their high schools or colleges, especially in these days of multimillion dollar salaries. But Ramirez won't, and he won't talk about it. ''It's kind of sad,'' Mandl said. ''He has his own agenda.'' Moorad once suggested that when Ramirez signed his eight-year contract with Boston four years ago, Mandl tried publicly to induce him to give money to the team. Mandl denied any such effort. Any time he has talked about his former player, Mandl said, it was usually in the interest of trying to protect or defend him. But, Mandl added, a friend of Ramirez's, in relaying the comments to the player, has misinterpreted his words to make them come out the opposite of what the coach has intended. But if Ramirez was turned off by Mandl's public comments then, what happened in the seven years before that when he played for Cleveland and earned slightly more than $15 million? Mandl said he didn't ask Ramirez for money then or later. ''It's not something I've ever discussed with him,'' Mandl said. ''I've never asked him for something and never will. If he comes to me and says, 'I want you to have this, Coach,' I'll say thank you very much. What he does with his money is none of my business.'' But the coach said he had learned from his experience with Ramirez. ''When the kids say to me now we need uniforms, ask Manny,'' Mandl said, ''I say remember that when we come to you.''

If it were listed by who had the best chance at the job, it would have probably read: Willie Randolph, Rudy Jaramillo and Terry Collins. All three finalists will return to Shea Stadium tomorrow for a second round of interviews, and the Mets are expected to introduce a manager later in the week. Randolph was considered the favorite when the search began, and he has seemingly done nothing to jeopardize his standing. Jim Duquette, the Mets' senior vice president for baseball operations, contacted Jim Leyland last week to gauge his interest in the position, and team officials discussed whether to interview him. But as of last night, Leyland said he had not heard from the Mets and did not expect to be included in the process. Leyland interviewed with the Philadelphia Phillies yesterday, and even though he has some interest in the Mets, it sounds as if General Manager Omar Minaya prefers to hire a first-time manager. During a phone conversation early last month, Minaya told Leyland he wanted to go with ''a young guy,'' and he has apparently stuck to his plan. ''If they want to interview me, then I'll interview with them,'' said Leyland, 59, a St. Louis Cardinals scout who managed the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Florida Marlins and the Colorado Rockies. ''If they want to talk to me, I'll talk to them. But I think Omar wants a younger manager and I really respect that.'' Minaya released a statement through a club spokesman last night that said he spoke with Leyland during the World Series and they agreed that Leyland would call Minaya after the interview in Philadelphia. Minaya said he had not heard from Leyland as of last night. Minaya interviewed five candidates in the first round and eliminated two former managers -- Carlos Tosca and Jim Riggleman. Among the finalists, Randolph and Jaramillo have never managed. Randolph served as the Yankees' bench coach last season, and Jaramillo was the Texas Rangers' hitting coach. Collins was fired twice, first in Houston, then in Anaheim, where players complained about his fiery style and petitioned the general manager for his dismissal. Minaya indicated last week that a second round of interviews would be used only to repeat what was said in the first round and help him reach a decision. The fact that all three interviews are scheduled for the same day suggests they will be much shorter than the initial meetings. Most of the factors seem to favor Randolph, who emerged from the first round sounding confident. He referred to the Mets as ''we'' and ''us'' and volunteered that he had begun outlining a coaching staff. Mets officials have insisted that they are pleased with all the finalists, citing Collins's energy, Jaramillo's expertise and Randolph's overall improvement. The Mets interviewed Randolph two years ago, and this time around, he has come across as better prepared. INSIDE PITCH The Mets will buy out the final year of outfielder Richard Hidalgo's contract for $2 million, rather than pick up the $15 million option. The Mets could still bring back Hidalgo at a reduced rate.

They had only 11 starts from left-handers in 2004, the fewest in any season in 57 years. That may change soon. If the Yankees are interested in Eric Milton as a free agent, he is interested in them. Milton filed for free agency yesterday, and he may explore the idea of returning to the organization that drafted him in the first round in 1996. Milton, 29, spent last season with the Philadelphia Phillies after pitching for Minnesota for six years. The Yankees had traded him to the Twins in the Chuck Knoblauch deal in 1998. ''I think there are many people within the organization that felt, 'It's a matter of time before we get him back,''' said Milton's agent, Casey Close. Close also represents Derek Jeter. ''It's kind of the way the Yankees operate. They like their own. ''They hated to part with him at the time, but the opportunity to come back is always there when you're a free agent. Now, we've reached that point. I think he's intrigued by the possibility.'' Close said Milton also had an interest in returning to Philadelphia, where he went 14-6 with a 4.75 earned run average last season. Another left-hander, the Los Angeles Dodgers' Odalis Perez, also filed for free agency yesterday. Two other left-handers, David Wells and Al Leiter -- who has a $10 million mutual option on his Mets contract -- have not yet filed; Leiter is expected to remain with the Mets. Teams have exclusive negotiating rights with their own free agents until midnight Nov. 11. The Yankees have until midnight Saturday to exercise their $8 million option on starter Jon Lieber, who will become a free agent if they decline. ''I have no doubt that they do want him back,'' Rex Gary, Lieber's agent, said. ''They shouldn't have any doubt that Jon wants to come back.'' If the Yankees decide $8 million is too high for next season, they could try to re-sign Lieber to a multiyear contract with a lower base salary for next year. The Yankees could try to trade for Arizona's Randy Johnson, 41. They failed to acquire him last July and have nothing more to trade now. The principal owner, George Steinbrenner, wants the rotation to get younger, but he could be lured by the free agent Pedro Mart\u00ednez, who is expected to file for free agency soon. The best young pitcher on the market may be Carl Pavano, a right-hander who will be 29 in January and who went 18-8 last season for Florida. Pavano has not yet filed for free agency; his agent, Scott Shapiro, said he wanted to meet first with Marlins General Manager Larry Beinfest. ''In this market, I think there's going to be a premium on starting pitching,'' Shapiro said. ''I don't know if the Marlins have the financial wherewithal to provide what amounts to a competitive bid.'' Shapiro said Pavano would be open to playing for the Yankees, the Mets or the Boston Red Sox. The right-hander Derek Lowe and catcher Jason Varitek were among 10 Red Sox who filed for free agency yesterday. Also filing were shortstop Orlando Cabrera; the backup catcher Doug Mirabelli; the right-handers Curtis Leskanic, Ramiro Mendoza and Scott Williamson; the left-hander Mike Myers; first baseman Dave McCarty; and second baseman Pokey Reese.

And the street fighter from Chicago's West Side comes out. If a boorish fan accosts Thomas and wants a fight, verbal or otherwise, he will probably get it. Take a swing at the Knicks, and their president punches back. Not with a fist (although he is capable), but with hard stares and cutting words and, sometimes, with that dangerously disarming smile. Thomas needed the full arsenal after he took control of the Knicks last December. He wanted to know the city. So he rode the subways into Brooklyn and the Bronx and occasionally walked a few dozen blocks to his office at Madison Square Garden. The city, it turned out, was feeling surly. ''I almost got into a couple fights,'' Thomas said with a mischievous grin. ''People were talking bad about my players.'' The discontent was understandable. The Knicks were heading toward a third consecutive losing season, with a roster of overpaid underachievers and nondescript journeymen. Thomas was trying to change all that, but this is New York, and there was little patience. Not everyone was enthralled with the risk-taking, smooth-talking interloper from the Midwest who had been hired to turn the team around. The smack talk flew. And occasionally, someone would step over the line. ''I remember telling this guy, 'You can say that stuff to your friend, but don't say that stuff to me about my players,''' Thomas said. ''They were talking New York smack,'' he added. ''I was talking Chicago smack. In New York, people get in your face and they talk and they banter. Chicago, you get in somebody's face, you get your butt kicked. That's what I was telling the guy: 'Don't get in my face.''' Feisty Face of a Franchise It is Thomas's face that matters most these days in all things Knicks. The chairman of Madison Square Garden, James L. Dolan, is a media-averse businessman with limited basketball acumen. The team's coach, Lenny Wilkens, is an old-school gym rat who would rather teach his players than pontificate to reporters. Fearful of saying something impolitic, Wilkens rarely says much beyond the obvious and the predictable. That leaves Thomas, who is entering his first full season as the Knicks' basketball boss, as the undisputed face and voice of the franchise. It is a role he embraces, even if it is one he never envisioned taking. When Dolan and Steve Mills, the Madison Square Garden president, called him on Dec. 19, Thomas was in Chicago, spending time with his mother, Mary. Over the course of a long day of shopping and manicures, Thomas had called everyone he knew on his cellphone until he had run out of distractions. Now his phone was ringing. Dolan and Mills asked Thomas if he was interested in a position with the Knicks, not specifying which one. But Thomas -- at the time weighing two college coaching offers -- did not need specifics. Mills asked him, ''How soon could you get here to interview?'' ''I said, 'I can get on the next plane,''' Thomas said. He chuckled as he recounted the story, noting that he was wearing gym shoes and a sweatsuit. Thomas drove to Indianapolis, still his home after being fired as the Indiana Pacers' coach in August, to pick up a suit and tie and his basketball material -- playbooks, the N.B.A.'s labor agreement, everything. Three days later, he was being introduced as the Knicks' president, and implicitly, as the team's savior. An ominous task, to be sure, given the state of the team, but Thomas, who became a Hall of Fame point guard with the Detroit Pistons, has never hesitated to gamble on himself. In 1994, he joined the expansion Toronto Raptors as a part-owner and vice president. Among Thomas's draft picks were Damon Stoudamire, who became rookie of the year; Marcus Camby; and Tracy McGrady. After leaving the Raptors, Thomas purchased the flagging Continental Basketball Association. Then came his three-year run as coach of the Pacers. ''This is an unusual individual, in that he has so many skill sets, and his intellect is very, very high,'' said Brendan Suhr, the Knicks' director of player personnel, who is Thomas's longtime friend and who coached him as an assistant in Detroit. At every stop, Thomas's reputation was the same: aggressive, savvy, political and sometimes abrasive, loyal to those who showed loyalty and intolerant of those who went their own way. Sure enough, two days after Thomas took the reins, he waived Slavko Vranes and brought the rookie prospect Mike Sweetney off the injured list. Two weeks later, Thomas swung the blockbuster deal that brought Stephon Marbury and Penny Hardaway from Phoenix for Antonio McDyess, the injured former All-Star, and four others. After a couple of years of wandering in a desert of irrelevance, the Knicks were suddenly interesting again. Thomas searched for the words to describe the state of the team when he arrived and finally settled on ''apathy.'' ''We were really in a crisis here,'' he said. Fans, disillusioned with the Knicks' direction under the previous general manager, Scott Layden, responded immediately, and many of them enthusiastically. ''There is now hope, and people recognize it,'' said Martin Cornman, 33, of Rochester, who along with his brother Andrew, runs the fan-driven Web site, ultimateknicks.com. ''During the Layden years, it was ho-hum.'' The Web site tells the story. In the months before Thomas took over, ultimateknicks.com received an average of 5,000 hits a day, Cornman said. Since Thomas joined the Knicks, the site has averaged 17,000 hits a day. Fans Finally Take Notice Not everyone is in Thomas's camp, though few argue with the results. The Knicks made the playoffs after Thomas turned over most of the roster and changed coaches, hiring Wilkens to replace Don Chaney. And even the critics are talking about the Knicks more than they were a year ago, if the Internet fan sites are any indication. ''They have a lot of young guys who are athletic, with good potential. We're not talking about Ward and Eisley and Weatherspoon anymore,'' said Cornman, referring to Charlie Ward, Howard Eisley and Clarence Weatherspoon, all of whom Thomas traded. Instead, fans are buzzing about Jamal Crawford, a potential All-Star guard acquired by Thomas this summer, and Trevor Ariza, a high-flying rookie from U.C.L.A. Magazines and N.B.A. executives are picking the Knicks to win the Atlantic Division. Thomas has lived in New York only 10 months, but he radiates a New York sensibility. His tailored suits and million-dollar smile are pure Madison Avenue. Raised in a crime-ridden West Chicago neighborhood, he exudes a toughness that is straight Bronx. He has a salesman's charm, a street kid's resilience. When the standard canon of criticisms is raised -- his quick departure from Toronto, his failed tenure as owner of the C.B.A. -- he pointedly defends his honor, but without allowing himself to sound defensive or agitated. Nor does he betray any doubts or regrets about the past or about the present. When a reporter asked recently about his team's weaknesses, Thomas flatly, very seriously, responded, ''I will never talk about our weaknesses.'' A street fighter never would. ''Why let the enemy know how to attack you?'' he said. Thomas was here when the lights went out in Manhattan in the blackout of 2003. When he moved to New York months later, he took up residence on the Upper West Side and commuted to work on the 1-9 line. He has since purchased a home in Westchester County and is as apt to travel by limousine as by foot, but Thomas has the city's pulse. He wants his players to learn it, too. To that end, Thomas ordered that all game-day shootarounds be held at the Garden, rather than at the team's Westchester practice facility. ''When you get on the subway,'' he said, ''there's a guy sitting next to you making $20 million a year. There's another guy sitting across making $100,000. There's somebody sitting next to you making $15,000. There's a homeless person. Kids getting on the train, hustling, turning flips. Black, white, Jewish. I don't care how much money you make, you're getting your butt on the train.'' Or taking a cab and getting stuck in traffic. Commuting, Thomas said, is the city's great equalizer. ''In New York,'' he said, ''everybody's the same.'' No Time to Waste The work ethic here is high, and tolerance for slackers and underachievers is low. Losing is tolerated least of all. In other cities, a franchise with a bloated payroll and lousy record might strip down, clear salary-cap space, hit the draft lottery and start over. This city does not accept five-year rebuilding plans, however, and Thomas was too savvy to attempt that route. Rather than keep players with expiring contracts to reduce payroll, he traded those players to acquire Crawford. The payroll blew past $100 million, but the Knicks are competitive again. If the city is reciprocating Thomas's respect, perhaps it is because it recognizes the gestures, obvious and subtle. Even his face-lift of the Knicks has a New York flavor. The coach he hired (Wilkens) and the point guard he traded for (Marbury) hail from Brooklyn. Tim Thomas, the forward Thomas acquired in February, is from Paterson, N.J. Hope does not equal victories and excitement does not automatically beget championships, but Thomas's smooth talk and relentless tinkering have given sustenance to a city starved for basketball glory. According to the team's best-known New Yorker, the city is grateful. ''Isiah is the real deal, baby,'' Marbury said. ''You've got to appreciate what he's done. If you don't, something's wrong with you. He came and rejuvenated the whole city. Look at how many people are coming to the preseason games. They want to see the team.''

''Bah, bah, bah,'' Wade said playfully over O'Neal's soft rolling speech. O'Neal raised an eyebrow in a half-mocking rebuke of Wade, who knew when to duck away. Wade did not see O'Neal turn back to his audience, his upper lip curling subtly into a smile that seemed to suggest that this time, things would be different. ''I knew what I was doing when I asked to be traded,'' O'Neal said. The scene at practice a week before the start of the N.B.A. season offered a window into O'Neal's grand new world in Miami, but also a reminder of his previous palm-tree stops. O'Neal has left his size-22EEE imprint on the league in 12 years and during three championship seasons, but the backcourt company he kept and left in Orlando and Los Angeles has also defined his Hall of Fame career. His partnerships with Penny Hardaway and Kobe Bryant started with similar honeymoon moments of shared purpose before turning into feuds over team identity. In Hollywood, a feud exploded into a public and messy divorce. ''I'm intelligent enough to know when the ship that I'm not controlling is sinking,'' O'Neal said in an interview last week. ''I'm smart enough to get off, get on the raft, go all the way from the Pacific, get a ship and be over here in the Atlantic.'' Ultimately, the success of the Heat's tidal-wave trade for O'Neal will rest on the emerging partnership of O'Neal and Wade, and on how quickly they can make their teammates better. O'Neal, 32, left more than bitterness in Los Angeles. At 331 pounds, he is 34 pounds lighter than he was last season. He is particularly conscious of not repeating the past with Wade. ''I learned from my experiences,'' he said. ''I just got to be a little different with him. I'll probably never raise my voice, but I'm going to stay on him.'' When the Heat completed the trade with the Lakers on July 14, O'Neal was the one welcoming Wade. ''He told me, everything I heard about him, you could throw it out the window, that he's one of the coolest guys you'd want to meet,'' Wade recalled after practice last week. ''He said, 'I'm coming down here to make you an All-Star, help us win a championship.''' Wade, 22, was in awe. When they met in Miami, O'Neal said he took Wade to a club to discuss the ins and outs of Hardaway and Bryant. ''I said, 'Look, this is what went on and we got to make sure it never happens between us,''' O'Neal said. ''And it won't. Because I come out here to do something for Pat, do something for myself,'' he added, referring to the Heat president, Pat Riley. ''And it's going to get done. It's a different type of team.'' The difference starts with Wade, who is married with a 2-year-old son. Riley calls Wade, the fifth pick in the 2003 draft, a throwback because of his selfless personality and professionalism. A year after Wade led Marquette to the N.C.A.A. Final Four, he led the Heat to the Eastern Conference semifinals as a rookie. With an explosive first step, he can drive and pass and execute a pick-and-roll as doggedly as he can defend against it. A quiet leader, he was the team's top scorer in the playoffs (18 points a game). At the Olympics, he led the United States team in steals (17). Larry Brown, the United States coach, came to rely on Wade, playing him more than the higher-profile rookies LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony. In Athens, Wade did not shoot well -- in part because he hesitated in Brown's system -- but no one else on the team shot well either. Wade eagerly returned to Miami to begin learning the finer art of throwing the ball in to O'Neal. At the news conference/parade to introduce him in Miami, O'Neal promised the city a championship and proclaimed, ''This is Dwyane Wade's team.'' That claim might have held, Riley said, if the Heat not sold 4,000 season tickets on the mere rumor that O'Neal was coming. A Shaq in Black banner hangs outside the arena. Wade has no illusions about whose team it is. ''I got one of the best players in the world, I'm going to take that as a blessing,'' Wade said. ''I'm a team player, always have been, always will be. Everybody's got their own agendas, of course. Everyone is going to get what they want if they do it as a team -- that's the motto I go by.'' The intriguing question about the Heat this season is how far it can go with nine new players, after trading Lamar Odom, Caron Butler and Brian Grant for O'Neal. ''Is there depth and are the other players good enough?'' Jerry West, the Memphis Grizzlies' president, said. ''Pat did a good job of surrounding Shaq with shooters.'' Riley sold O'Neal on the talent of the young forwards Rasual Butler and Udonis Haslem. Riley then brought in Damon Jones, Wesley Person and Keyon Dooling. Michael Doleac and Wang Zhizhi are O'Neal's backups. The veteran guard Eddie Jones, who led the team in scoring last season (17.3 points a game), considers himself the X-factor. Opponents are quick to caution that the addition of O'Neal does not make for an instant title. But O'Neal, playing with a California-sized chip on his shoulder after averaging 11.5 rebounds and a career-low 21.5 points last season, presents a physical and mental challenge for every opponent. ''There's no one in the league who can match up with him,'' Donnie Walsh, the Indiana Pacers' president, said. ''I've never seen a situation like that.'' Riley is trying to rein in expectations. ''I don't know if you can say this is going to be a championship team this year,'' he said. ''I think the upside for improvement is a lot better than other teams.'' Stan Van Gundy, the coach who took over when Riley resigned last season, wants to see a defensive improvement from a team that went 4-3 in the preseason. He cannot worry about the big what-if -- injury. O'Neal has missed 25 games in each of the last three seasons, mostly because of an arthritic toe and a sore knee. ''We played two games in the preseason without Shaq; we can do it,'' Van Gundy said. ''Obviously, that's not what we prefer.'' O'Neal remains bothered by a left hamstring pull sustained early in training camp, but he says he is still hopeful that he can play the opener at the Nets tomorrow. (Detroit tips off the season against visiting Houston tonight). When Riley asked him to drop from 365 pounds, O'Neal curtailed lifting weights and began four hours of cardiovascular training a day. O'Neal's determination is in line with Wade's. ''He's an all-around player -- he doesn't only make me better, he makes everybody better,'' O'Neal said. ''Every championship team has a 1-2 punch, guys that are going to do their thing every night and the guys around them.'' O'Neal seems re-energized as a teacher, a role he found trying with Bryant and Hardaway. ''I got both of those guys when they were young,'' O'Neal said. ''It was my job to keep them on track, or I was told to keep them on track. And that didn't work. ''The other two guys were into themselves, and you had to do this all the time. That gets tiresome. I tried to be a big brother, but the people upstairs were like, 'Kobe do this, do that.' When stuff is not done right, you're in trouble.'' Hardaway, 33, was encouraged to hear that O'Neal had gone out of his way to embrace Wade. ''That's good, Dwyane is getting a more mature, really understanding guy that's a veteran,'' said Hardaway, a reserve guard for the Knicks. ''That's why he's bringing way more to the Miami Heat than just his presence.'' O'Neal is living on exclusive Star Island, between South Beach and the arena, alongside neighbors like Gloria Estefan and the rapper P. Diddy. O'Neal purchased a furnished house (customized for the former Heat center Rony Seikaly) for nearly $20 million for his wife and five children. A rapper, an actor and a perpetual marketer, he is stimulated by the new possibilities in Miami. O'Neal, alias Superman or Diesel or Shaq Daddy, has already nicknamed Wade after a superhero. ''I was watching this kid play the other day, and he was so fast, so I thought, 'Flash,' we can do a lot with that,'' O'Neal said. ''Maybe DC Comics will be calling.'' Wade said he would leave the creativity to O'Neal. ''I'm going to do whatever I can to make what he said about me look right,'' he said. Could this be the beginning of an enduring partnership, worthy of Magic and Kareem? ''I don't really look at that,'' Wade said. ''Shaq is Shaq. If I continue to get better, I think it could be something that could be talked about without all the problems.''

From 6:30 a.m., when the presidential motorcade left a downtown Cincinnati illuminated only by streetlamps, to 1:40 a.m. Tuesday, when his Marine One helicopter was scheduled to touch down in the darkness of Prairie Chapel Ranch, near Waco, Mr. Bush logged 2,548 miles and 19 straight hours at seven rallies in six states, five of them too close to call -- and all essential to a victory should he lose Florida. ''That finish line is in sight,'' Mr. Bush told reporters as he arrived in Pittsburgh, his second stop of the day. ''And I just want to assure you I've got the energy, the optimism and the enthusiasm to cross the line.'' At each stop, Mr. Bush exhorted the crowd to vote in an election in which the winner is almost certain to be the man who turns out more of his own party's supporters. ''I'm here to ask for your help,'' Mr. Bush said at his first stop in an airport hangar in rural Wilmington, Ohio, where Marine One roared to a halt soon after dawn. ''You get your friends and neighbors to go to the polls. Find our fellow Republicans, wise independents and discerning Democrats and tell them, if they want a safer America and a stronger America and a better America, to put me and Dick Cheney back in office.'' In Milwaukee, his third stop, Mr. Bush rallied supporters only a few blocks and an hour apart from his opponent, Senator John Kerry. Later, parts of the two men's motorcades crossed paths near the airport, as a bus of White House reporters drove past Mr. Kerry's campaign plane, which was parked on the other side of the airport from Air Force One. For the last rally of the day, Mr. Bush returned home to Texas, into a jammed sports arena at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where his wife, Laura, went to college, for an 11 p.m. rally filled with thousands of young people waving red and white ''W'' signs and one reading ''First Cowboy.'' It was a rarity for Mr. Bush, who is usually in bed by that hour. But this evening, the ''Victory in Texas'' rally was the final stop of the final stretch, before the helicopter trip to his ranch. Even more of a rarity, Mr. Bush was running late, after an 18-hour, seven-day tour that clearly left the president unusually emotional. ''Ten years ago, when I ran for governor, we had our last campaign rally in Dallas,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I have a pretty good feeling texas is going to be a red state tomorrow.'' EarlierMonday Mr. Bush's aides, after asserting for weeks that they were confident and calm, finally admitted in the last marathon stretch that they were on edge. But they said the president was serene. ''Everybody's nervous,'' said Mark McKinnon, the president's chief media strategist. ''He has a total Zen attitude about it.'' Mr. McKinnon said that Mr. Bush was playing a running game of gin rummy throughout the day with Karl Rove, the White House political adviser, and other longtime aides in the conference room on Air Force One and that he felt he had done everything he had to do to win. ''He knew he had to earn it, not inherit it,'' Mr. McKinnon said. He added: ''I think both campaigns will go out swinging and say we left it all on the field. They ran tough and hard and we ran tough and hard.'' Notably, Mr. McKinnon spoke about the recent polls with less bravado than other Bush advisers in the closing days of the campaign, and made no promises of the outcome. ''We averaged it all out, and the numbers over the last week have been good for us -- better for us, anyway,'' Mr. McKinnon said. ''Ultimately, you can argue the numbers either way, but my acid test, at the end of the day, is I'd rather be us than them going into the final 24 hours.'' The race was so excruciatingly close for the White House that Mr. Bush spent some of the last hours of what he says will be his last campaign without his wife at his side. Mrs. Bush, after accompanying the president from Cincinnati to Wilmington, flew separately to rallies in Cleveland and Clinton Township, Mich., where she echoed the president's stump lines. ''Tomorrow, we face a choice between an America that is uncertain in the face of danger, or an America that takes decisive action to defeat terror and to spread liberty,'' she told a crowd at the International Exposition Center in a Democratic corner of Ohio. Mr. Bush apologized to the crowd in Burgettstown, Pa., for his wife's absence, saying that ''she's off on her own for a while, which is wise use of her time.'' Or, as Mr. McKinnon put it, ''In a tight race you want to make sure you have as many checkers on the board as you can.'' The White House dispatched Vice President Dick Cheney to Hawaii, where he spoke late Sunday night at a rally in Honolulu. Then he immediately turned around and flew to a rally in Colorado Springs long enough to make fun of the camouflage outfit that Mr. Kerry wore on a recent Ohio goose-hunting trip. ''If you want my opinion of the whole thing, John Kerry's goose is cooked,'' Mr. Cheney told a crowd at the Penrose Equestrian Center. The White House also announced that Mr. Bush would break with usual practice and campaign well into Election Day, on a stop in Columbus, Ohio, en route to Washington after voting Tuesday morning at the firehouse in Crawford, Tex.

''You guys look so wonderful, wet and bundled and all huddled up,'' Mr. Kerry told thousands of Wisconsin Democrats who smiled from under slickers and garbage bags and matted hair and spongy Kerry-Edwards signs now melted to their heads. President Bush had just rallied warm, dry Republicans indoors a few blocks away, and Mr. Kerry's motorcade got an eyeful of Air Force One as it ascended just as he pulled into town. But the sight from the stage set up at the corner of State and Water Streets -- emphasis on the water -- had the senator suddenly sentimental. ''You're the best!'' he shouted. He was headed next to Detroit, where Stevie Wonder opened for him to a booming arena crowd of Teamsters and auto workers, and on to Cleveland, where an election-eve performance by Bruce Springsteen drew tens of thousands. But Mr. Kerry seemed most moved in Milwaukee, as the crowd, index fingers jabbing in the air, began to thunder: ''One more day! One more day!'' Mr. Kerry smiled and took it all in. ''Unbelievable,'' he said. ''I tell you, it may be one more day, but I promise you this: I will never forget this rally in the rain here in Milwaukee. Unbelievable. You're unbelievable!'' From Orlando, Fla., to Milwaukee to Detroit to Cleveland to Toledo, Ohio, and back to La Crosse, Wis. This was how Mr. Kerry was spending the last hours of the last day before the election that friends said he had dreamed of his entire life. ''I've heard your struggles, and I've shared your hopes,'' he told the Milwaukee crowd. ''And together, we have a chance tomorrow to move America forward, to start to make a difference in the lives of so many millions of Americans and in the character of our country itself. That's what this is about.'' On this last day, he surrounded himself with family -- his daughters Alexandra and Vanessa got soaked with him in Milwaukee, and his sister Peggy was with him in Florida -- while his aides buoyed one another. The usually elusive Democratic strategist, Bob Shrum, said he was fairly sure Mr. Kerry would take Pennsylvania and that Ohio and Florida were trending his way. Reminded that Karl Rove and other aides to Mr. Bush were telling a very different story, Mr. Shrum said, ''They believe that saying they're going to win helps you win.'' Asked if he was doing the same, he said, ''I do believe we're going to win.'' Mr. Kerry seemed as loose on stage as those around him, engaging his audiences at every step, mugging for laughs as he mocked Mr. Bush's debate body language and basking in every yelled ''You're the man, John!'' and ''We love you!'' When he told thousands in Detroit that the Big Three in the administration's eyes were not Ford, Chrysler and General Motors but ''Halliburton, Enron and the drug companies,'' the crowd filled the arena with boos. ''Wow,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''Rather than booing -- are you ready to change it?'' They made clear they were. Mr. Kerry arrived in Toledo shortly after midnight, and gave his first speech of Election Day to almost a thousand people in an airport hangar. Several thousand more people outside could not get in. ''I don't know if George Bush is at home in bed in Crawford,'' Mr. Kerry said, ''but I am here fighting for every single vote.'' Mr. Kerry began his day with prayer, and he spied good luck charms at every stop. After attending Mass in Orlando, he got a long hug at the airport from a touchstone friend: William Zaladonis, a member of his Swift boat crew in Vietnam who had campaigned for Mr. Kerry for months. After a quick speech he left Florida for the last time before the election. In Milwaukee, with his Red Sox cap pulled on tight, Mr. Kerry thanked the Green Bay Packers for beating the Redskins in Washington on Sunday, as good an omen as any: ''Every presidential election since 1936, when the Redskins lose, the incumbent loses,'' he said, as thousands of ''Cheeseheads'' let out a yell. In Detroit, he picked out a handmade sign saying ''Nick Kids Pick Kerry 57 Percent'' -- and announced that the children's poll conducted by the Nickelodeon cable channel had ''never been wrong.'' And in front of some 50,000 people in Cleveland, Mr. Springsteen handed Mr. Kerry his guitar pick and told him to take it to the Oval Office. But it was in Milwaukee that Mr. Kerry seemed most relaxed, most self-deprecating, most glad and grateful to have made the long journey that was at last coming to a close. He jokingly threatened to give one of his stentorian speeches. And had it not been for the rain, he might have seemed almost misty-eyed. ''This is a kind of magical moment,'' he said, ''that we get to in the last hours of the most blessed gift on the face of the planet: our democracy; your vote. You get to choose and change the direction of this country. And tomorrow, the choice of a lifetime is on that ballot.'' In the middle of the street, Alissa Gonyea, 33, a kindergarten teacher, held her nephew, Connor Erickson, 8, to her waist to keep the rain from soaking through his clothes. ''This is our third Kerry rally,'' Ms. Gonyea said, making clear that Connor was the big Kerry fan in the family. ''Yesterday he went trick-or-treating and he wouldn't go to any houses with George Bush signs. He said 'I don't want their candy.''' Connor said nothing, but he was smiling wide.

His fellow safety Brent Alexander coaches him constantly on the field between plays. The cornerbacks add their pointers. In the meetings, they all make sure he is paying attention to the right details. ''I would be lost without them,'' Wilson said. But somewhere along the way, while everyone worried how a rookie would handle being rushed into the starting lineup with two safeties out for the season, Wilson's defensive teammates are realizing that they would be the ones utterly lost without him. It was a lesson they learned again Sunday in an impressive defensive performance against the Vikings. Wilson led the team in tackles and had an interception. ''I couldn't play at the level he's playing at when I was a rookie,'' said defensive end Michael Strahan, shaking his head and marveling at his teammate. ''He's so much more advanced than any rookie I've ever seen. He's played like he's been here forever. He's definitely the best rookie I've ever played with and I've played with a lot of good ones.'' Strahan, a 12-year veteran, then pronounced Wilson the most valuable player on the defense. That is quite a compliment for a player the Giants snatched in the fifth round of the draft last April with no fanfare. Wilson was a two-year starter at Tennessee who had a reputation as a fierce tackler. His speed caught the attention of the Giants' scouts. But at 6 feet and 197 pounds only after a big meal, Wilson does not look like anyone's prototypical big-hitting safety. At 22, he still looks like a teenager. And no one, not even the Giants' personnel gurus, foresaw Wilson jumping into such a huge role so quickly after injuries sidelined the veterans Shaun Williams and Omar Stoutmire early in the season. Wilson has made plays from every spot on the field. He has three interceptions and two sacks, leads the team in tackles and is coming off perhaps his best game of the season. He had one interception against Vikings quarterback Daunte Culpepper and could have had another. He single-handedly broke up a screen pass by slicing between two blockers to make the tackle. He was caught blitzing on a run play to the other side, but he still caught the runner and dragged him down from behind. ''He played the way we have come to expect him to play,'' Coach Tom Coughlin said. ''He played with outstanding energy and anticipation. He was very physical. The screen that he broke up was a very good play. He had an interception, and I told him he might have had two more.'' Although his coaches and teammates watch film and marvel at his abilities, Wilson said he saw mostly mistakes. While everyone else is forgetting he is a rookie, he gets reminders all the time. He said that without Alexander's guidance, he would not be able to recognize all the shifts in the opposing offense, small changes that can make a big difference in how a defense should react. ''There was plenty of stuff that I messed up on,'' Wilson said of his game against the Vikings. ''By far, that was not a good game by any means.'' On the play when he intercepted Culpepper, he said he was scrambling to cover a receiver he had mistakenly let run by him. He was closing on tight end Jermaine Wiggins when Culpepper threw the ball short, and Wilson snagged it. The trick has been having the speed and awareness to make up for his mistakes. He also has a knack for pouncing on the other team's mistakes. Snatching turnovers has become the backbone of the Giants' surprising defense -- they are tied for the league lead in turnover differential at plus-12 with Detroit -- and Wilson has led the way. ''He's a young guy that has a lot of talent and a lot of spunk,'' cornerback Will Allen said. ''He flies around out there. That's what we need. I think he's more athletic than most safeties, so he can make a lot of plays. ''Bottom line, he's helping us win. No doubt about that.'' EXTRA POINTS The Giants are awaiting test results on linebacker Barrett Green, who left Sunday's game with a sprained knee and a sprained ankle. The amount of swelling suggested the injuries were not minor. Center Shaun O'Hara will spend another few days in a Manhattan hospital trying to fight off an infection in his leg. Coach Tom Coughlin said he had no idea how long O'Hara's recovery would be. Coughlin praised the backup center Wayne Lucier for his performance in the tough environment of the Metrodome.

After spending the week facing questions on how they would rebound from their disappointing loss to New England, the Jets turned in a commanding 41-14 victory over Miami on Monday night, their most complete game of the season. The Jets had two runners with at least 100 yards -- Curtis Martin with 115 yards on 19 carries, and LaMont Jordan with 115 yards on 14 carries -- for the first time since 1975. The Jets' wide receivers, who had caught only one touchdown all season, caught two on Monday. And then there was Pennington, who was 11 of 19 passing for 189 yards. The defense was just as impressive. The linemen put pressure on Dolphins quarterback Jay Fiedler all game, sacking him four times. The secondary held the Miami receivers to 218 yards and intercepted two of Fiedler's passes. And the Dolphins were held to 78 yards rushing. ''We hadn't had a game where all three phases played well,'' Coach Herman Edwards said. ''But tonight was our night.'' It was precisely the kind of victory that the Jets needed to wash the taste of last week's loss to the Patriots out of their mouths. The victory also allowed the Jets to keep pace with New England and Pittsburgh, who are also 6-1, as the top teams in the American Football Conference. ''That was our mind-set coming in tonight,'' Edwards said. ''We wanted to keep pace with the Patriots and obviously the Steelers.'' The Jets matched their victory total from last season and also notched the 300th victory in the franchise's 44-year history. The success of the Jets' offense was all the more impressive considering that it came against a Miami defense that entered the game ranked fifth over all. The Jets' total of 275 yards rushing was a single-game high in the league this season. ''I think our team showed what we're made of,'' Pennington said. The cylinders began firing halfway through the first quarter after the Jets forced their 15th turnover of the season, when safety Reggie Tongue jarred the ball loose from Dolphins tight end Donald Lee. Taking over at their 49 , the Jets went to work quickly. Curtis Martin ran for 17 yards in 2 plays, including a 14-yard gain that was largely made possible by a strong pulling block by guard Jonathan Goodwin. Then, on first-and-10 from the Dolphins' 35 , the Jets lined up with three receivers to the left side of the formation. Wayne Chrebet lined up and Pennington found him for a touchdown pass on a seam route with 7 minutes 32 seconds left in the first. It was the only the second touchdown by a Jets wide receiver this season and the first since Jonathan Carter scored in the season opener against Cincinnati. There would be more catches and more touchdowns for the receivers, but not until the Jets went through a stretch in which they struggled to convert third downs, much as they did early in the season. On the next four drives, the Jets got great field position. None of their drives started deeper than their 37, but each ended with a punt after three plays. Some of the Jets' struggles on third down could be attributed to the solid play of the Dolphins' defense. In the teams' first meeting last month, the Dolphins held the Jets to their lowest third-down conversion rate of the season, 1 for 11. But some of the Jets' difficulties seemed to stem from a lack of execution. On consecutive series -- both on third and 2 -- Pennington threw a slant pass too high for Justin McCareins and was sacked. The first third-down conversion by either team came in the second quarter on the Dolphins' first scoring drive. Pinned at their 9, the Dolphins moved forward when Fiedler connected with tight end Randy McMichael on a 28-yard pass on a seam route. It was an excellent throw by Fiedler, who threaded the ball to McMichael despite excellent coverage by Jets linebacker Eric Barton, who ran stride for stride with him. Besides the big gain, Miami benefited when defensive end John Abraham -- who had already sacked Fiedler once and had hurried him on several other occasions -- left the game. The Dolphins took advantage of Abraham's absence, moving 34 yards before Abraham returned. The Dolphins capped the drive with a 21-yard touchdown pass to McMichael with 4:42 left in the first half. The score seemed to spark the Jets. On their next series, they converted their first third down of the game on a 14-yard run by Jordan on third and 1. The Jets ended the drive with a 27-yard touchdown pass to McCareins with 1:17 left in the half. On the play, McCareins ran at the Dolphins' perennial Pro Bowl cornerback Sam Madison before making an out cut so sharp that Madison seemed to lose his footing. But it was too late. McCareins pulled in the ball, tiptoed along the sideline and nudged the tip of the ball over the pylon at the goal line. ''I told him next time don't be so dramatic,'' Edwards said. ''Just touch the cone.'' It was the first of six consecutive scores by the Jets' offense. After another three plays and out by the Dolphins, the Jets got the ball back with 20 seconds left in the first half. They moved 39 yards in 4 plays to set up a 49-yard field goal by Doug Brien as the half expired to put the Jets ahead, 17-7. The Jets took the field after halftime seemingly buoyed by their proficiency at the end of the first half. The scores came quickly -- Martin on a 25-yard touchdown run, a Chris Baker touchdown catch from Pennington, another Brien field goal, Jordan scoring from 25 yards out -- until the Jets rang up 34 unanswered points. The Jets led by 34-7 in the fourth quarter. The score was reminiscent of the last time the Jets and the Dolphins met on Monday night. That was in 2000, when Miami carried a 30-7 lead into the fourth quarter, then gave it all back in a 40-37 overtime victory for the Jets. Moving the team with a hurry-up offense, Fiedler, who was the quarterback in the 2000 loss, seemed determined to try to complete the role reversal with a comeback of his own. But facing third and one, Fiedler dropped back and aimed a ball to McMichael that was intercepted by safety Jon McGraw. There would be no comeback. Not on the Jets' night.

But what are the Jets to do if and when the veteran Sam Cowart returns from his knee injury and is ready to play middle linebacker? Cowart's role again was filled Monday night by Jonathan Vilma, who excelled once more, this time in a 41-14 victory over the Miami Dolphins at Giants Stadium as the Jets raised their record to 6-1. Vilma is a first-round draft choice (12th over all) from the other Miami team, the Hurricanes. This was only his fifth start in the most demanding position on the defense. ''This was fun,'' Vilma said. ''It reminded me of the good old days at Miami. Asked what grade he would give himself, he said: ''A B, maybe a B-plus. I'm just getting more comfortable with making the right reads faster.'' He played with a poise beyond his experience and the skill of an emerging star with several starring moments in a prime-time showcase on national television. On the first play from scrimmage in the second quarter, Vilma slipped past the Dolphins blockers, cut sharply to his left and chased down the ball carrier Travis Minor. He flung Minor to the ground for a loss of a yard. When the Dolphins had to punt, Vilma stayed on with the coverage team and engaged Morlon Greenwood, a fellow Big East Conference linebacker from Syracuse, in a blocking contest that included several jousts in various spots of the field. It ended with Vilma trotting to the sideline as Greenwood spoke to Jeff Rice, the umpire. Early in the third quarter, after the Jets took a 24-7 lead, Vilma stifled a Miami drive when he helped defensive tackle Jason Ferguson sack quarterback Jay Fiedler for a loss of 14 yards. Early in the fourth quarter, he pressured Fiedler in the pocket to help create an interception by free safety Jon McGraw. Late in the quarter, when Miami's Sammy Morris caught a pass in the left flat and turned toward the end zone, Vilma threw him down for a 1-yard loss at the Jets' 3-yard line. No position on defense is more central to the alignment or crucial to a unit's performance than Vilma's. In a 4-3 set, the middle linebacker faces the sideline to learn the alignment and assignments from the coaches before calling or signaling the plan to his 10 teammates. This demands a calm demeanor and quick communication. Once the play starts, the middle linebacker must quickly decide whether to rush the passer, pursue a running back or cover a receiver. A hesitation or bad decision can instantly overburden a teammate and result in a big gain or even a touchdown. ''Jonathan is improving every week,'' Jets Coach Herman Edwards said. ''That's what he does. He made some big plays again tonight. That's why you draft a guy like that.'' Asked whether he expected Vilma to be so savvy so soon, Edwards said: '' You knew that when you drafted the guy. You knew what you were getting.'' For a first-year player to step into such responsibility and handle it so well is notable. In the games in which Vilma has been a starter, his team has given up 9, 14, 14, 13 and 14 points. He entered the lineup during the second game of the season after Cowart hurt his knee against San Diego late in the second quarter. Vilma's first professional start was on Oct. 3 at Miami, where he was watched by friends and family in his hometown. Vilma has 27 tackles, a sack and an interception this season. The interception was important. It came on Oct. 17 against San Francisco when the Jets led by 15-14 with 1 minute 44 seconds remaining. After he returned the Tim Rattay pass for 14 yards to the 49ers' 20-yard line, the Jets scored to increase their lead to 22-14, the final score. Unlike many defenders who enter and leave the game depending on down and distance situations, Vilma plays every down on scrimmage plays in addition to working on special teams for punts and kickoffs. At 6 feet 1 inch and 230 pounds, the 22-year-old Vilma is showing great potential. Cowart, who is 29, is a seven-year veteran and a former All-Pro player with Buffalo. At the very least, when he returns, the Jets will have depth. Vilma offered no solution to the team's dilemma. ''Leave it to the coaches,'' he said.

The ruling, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, reversed two lower courts that had blocked the challenges just a day before. It also came as squadrons of lawyers from both parties in Ohio and other swing states from Pennsylvania to Florida to New Mexico were preparing for Election Day skirmishes that will include using arcane laws that allow challenges at the polls. The lawyer for a pair of Cincinnati civil rights activists who had challenged the Republican plans to challenge voters said he would appeal Tuesday morning's decision to the United State Supreme Court. But it appeared likely that when Ohio polls open, the Republicans would be able to put 3,500 challengers inside polling places around the state. Democrats also planned to send more than 2,000 monitors to the polls, though they said those people would not challenge voters. The cases may foreshadow lawsuits that are likely to be filed if the election is close in any state crucial to the Electoral College calculus. Lawyers for both sides are already examining disparities in election policies, nuances in court rulings and potential irregularities at polling places for material that may be used to challenge results in places where margins are paper thin. The battle over Election Day challenges has been most intense in Ohio, not only because the race here is so close and so vital to President Bush and Senator John Kerry, but also because the Republican Party has announced larger and more aggressive plans to challenge voters here than in other states. The Republicans contend that challenging -- a practice that has been allowed under state law for decades but rarely used -- will weed out fraud often missed by election workers. Democrats assert that the challenges would disproportionately single out low-income and minority voters, which Republicans deny. In their separate rulings in the lower courts, Judge Susan J. Dlott of Federal District Court in Cincinnati and Judge John R. Adams in Akron agreed that procedures already existed to prevent fraud at the voting place. And they said aggressive, time-consuming challenges inside polling stations might create chaos and delays that could intimidate voters or rob them of the chance to vote. In seeking the delicate balance between preventing fraud and upholding voting rights, the judges said, the scales should tip toward voting rights. ''Voter intimidation severely burdens the right to vote, and prevention of such intimidation is a compelling state interest,'' wrote Judge Dlott, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton. Judge Adams was appointed by President Bush. Mark Weaver, counsel to the state's Republican Party, said: ''The goal of the Ohio Republican Party is to guarantee a fair election for everyone. Each time the Democrats remove an additional safeguard, the potential for voter fraud increases.'' Mr. Weaver argued that even if voters had been successfully challenged at the polls, they would have been allowed to cast provisional ballots, which are reviewed after Election Day to ensure that the voter is eligible. Democrats and many experts in election law say the rules for counting provisional ballots are varied and unclear, which could lead to valid ballots being rejected. The Ohio Republicans have repeatedly argued that the Democratic Party and allied groups have engaged in widespread fraud. On Monday, they filed a motion in state court asserting that the Democrats and an independent group, America Coming Together, which supports Senator Kerry, have been contacting Republicans and giving them incorrect information about polling locations and other Election Day issues. Democrats and the group denied the assertion. In a similar and perhaps redundant decision in New Jersey, a federal judge, Dickinson R. Debevoise, ruled Monday that the Republican National Committee and people under its control may not challenge Ohio voters using a list of 35,000 people prepared by local Republicans here. The list is based on mail returned as undeliverable. Judge Debevoise, ruling on a challenge filed by minority voters in Federal District Court in Newark, based his order Monday on a 1982 decision that prohibited the Republican National Committee from using so-called ballot security measures to frustrate efforts by members of minorities to vote. Judge Debevoise ruled that the 1982 decision, a consent order entered as part of a settlement in New Jersey, was national in scope and continued to be in effect. Lawyers for the Republicans filed an immediate appeal to the federal appeals court in Philadelphia. Even as the Ohio dispute was working its way through the courts, lawyers in other states were gearing up for Election Day challenges. In Philadelphia, Republicans have said they plan to challenge 10,000 voters in the heavily black West Philadelphia section because of what they say are concerns of registration fraud. Democratic Party lawyers are expected to ask judges to remove the challengers if they are overly aggressive. In Florida, Republicans have said they will challenge 1,700 people with felons convictions if they show up to vote. Democrats have mustered thousands of poll watchers whose job will be to ensure that voters are not intimidated. In New Mexico, officials in both parties said they were placing hundreds of lawyers in polling places as monitors. Democrats have said they will not challenge voters, but Republicans have held out the possibility of doing so. And in Wisconsin, a dispute over Election Day challenges was resolved amicably over the weekend when the two parties agreed to prepare a list of 5,512 people with questionable registrations, like those with discrepancies in their addresses. If those people attempt to vote, they will be asked to produce documentation showing their address. If they have no such proof, they will be allowed to vote, but their ballot will be tagged as challenged, meaning they might be rejected during a recount, officials said. As the parties geared up for Election Day and beyond, it was clear both had marshaled impressive forces, though the Democrats claimed to have the edge in troop strength. Robert F. Bauer, the Democratic National Committee's national counsel for voter protection, said the party had assembled the biggest collection of volunteer lawyers ever. ''It is the largest law firm in the United States,'' Mr. Bauer said of his team. ''If we paid everyone at the prevailing market rate, it would rank among the more robust economies in the world.'' Mindy Tucker Fletcher, a senior adviser to the Republican party in Florida, said she was unimpressed. ''Why is that something to be proud of?'' she asked, adding that ''we have lawyers in every county, and at the state level.'' Daniel J. Hoffheimer, the state legal counsel for the Kerry campaign in Ohio, said he had recruited lead lawyers in virtually every one of the state's 88 counties. He said three issues could ripen into postelection lawsuits if the vote was close in Ohio: provisional ballots, challenges to voters and absentee ballots. Both sides agreed that no one knew where significant trouble would break out or what specific legal issues would be involved. But all concerned said they had tried to learn from the litigation chaos in Florida in 2000. ''Last time everybody was entirely unprepared,'' said Barry Richard, who represented the Bush campaign in Florida in 2000. ''We had to organize very quickly. Nobody expected it to begin with and nobody expected the magnitude of it or the length of it. We suddenly found ourselves facing three trials, any one of which could have made the difference in the election.''

Instead, this mouse drew squeals of delight, for Ballet Theater was being visited by Angelina, the heroine of ''Angelina Ballerina,'' a popular children's book about a dancing mouse written by Katharine Holabird and illustrated by Helen Craig. Angelina -- or more accurately, a human being portraying her -- starred in ''The Ballerina,'' a new little ballet choreographed for the Halloween matinee by Kevin McKenzie, Ballet Theater's artistic director. While David LaMarche played excerpts from Schumann's ''Carnaval'' on an onstage piano, Angelina frisked about. Then she watched Veronika Part and Maxim Beloserkovsky in a pas de deux that had both dreamy and peppy moments. Angelina joined them in its finale and was awarded a bouquet during the curtain call. This was not the only appearance by Angelina, who was played by the woman who impersonates her at all promotional events featuring this character and who prefers not to reveal her name. During pauses between ballets, she and Susan Jaffe, a former ballerina of the company, went in front of the curtain and discussed the works to be performed next. All were pleasantly danced. Gillian Murphy and Marcelo Gomes starred in George Balanchine's ''Theme and Variations.'' Michele Wiles and David Hallberg were secure in the many difficult balances of Victor Gsovsky's ''Grand Pas Classique.'' Looking appropriately tender and dreamy, Maria Riccetto made her debut in the role of the Young Girl in Michel Fokine's ''Spectre de la Rose,'' in which Herman Cornejo was once again the Rose. And Jiri Kylian's ''Sinfonietta'' closed the program exultantly. Ormsby Wilkins and Mr. LaMarche conducted.

Schubert's F-minor Fantasy for one piano and two pianists is perhaps happiest when listened to by its performers in an otherwise empty room or, at most, with a friend or two on hand to turn the pages. On a raised stage in a darkened hall with an audience, this great music does not work. Bach on the keyboard -- and Daniel Barenboim played a lot of it at Carnegie Hall on Monday night -- asks similar questions about what the word performance once meant and what it means now. Seen from Bach's early-18th-century vantage, the 48 preludes and fugues of ''The Well-Tempered Clavier'' are a solitary pursuit: a textbook addressing the physical needs of polyphonic playing and, more important, a kind of correspondence course for the inquiring student, offering a university of spiritual contemplation. An almost-full Carnegie Hall, ready for an evening of ''The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book I,'' spoke for another point of view, telling us tacitly that Bach in the present-day concert hall works just fine. In their behalf, the composer does seem to have ordered these pieces for psychological effect: with long and profound minor-key fugues followed by fleet and upbeat preludes. Mr. Barenboim -- either cured of, or oblivious to, the back problems that caused him to cancel many recent events -- mediated between viewpoints. The stage was big, the lights were low, and from the modern piano was wrung every dramatic device the 19th century later offered. In contrast, the pianist used the score, turned his own pages and made just enough small errors to give the evening a homier, more spontaneous feeling. Bach also meant these pieces as an elaborate advertisement for a system of tuning in which he believed, a method not all that different from the one we use today. Music in the 1720's had gravitated toward major and minor keys. Old tuning had purer intervals and sounded fine in basic keys, but weird in distant ones. The well-tempered method favored by Bach dirtied pitch relationships to allow the easy hopping from key to key, a horizontal freedom that became fundamental to, for example, Wagner's music. The ''Well-Tempered Clavier'' pieces are in every key -- from the seven sharps of C-sharp major to the plain old white-key C major. You had to tune Bach's way to play them all. Arguing with Mr. Barenboim about tempo, tone and approach (and I could have on many occasions) was beside the point given his insistence that listeners hear Bach's counterpoint at work and that they experience a monumentality transcending any keyboard instrument. (We are not always sure which one Bach had in mind.) Book I, moreover, seems the more public, outgoing half of this huge work. Playing 24 preludes and fugues in one gulp was certainly not in the composer's mind, but the attention given here made the evening seem not so much a fiercely run marathon as a grand and leisurely walking tour of the mind and heart.

That system is the de facto enslavement of women in postcolonial India, despite the promises of democracy and modernity. Sakharam, a bookbinder, picks up other men's discarded women -- castoff wives who would otherwise be homeless, destitute or murdered with impunity -- and takes them in as domestic servants and sex partners. He rules his home like a tin-pot tyrant, yet each woman is told that she is free to leave whenever she likes. He will even give her a sari, 50 rupees and a ticket to wherever she wants to go. ''Everything good and proper, where Sakharam Binder is concerned,'' he says. ''He's no husband to forget common decency.'' What he doesn't anticipate are the moral and emotional complications of this arrangement, which prove heartbreakingly ruinous to everyone involved. Banned in India after its 1974 premiere, ''Sakharam Binder'' is the most famous and influential drama by Vijay Tendulkar, India's foremost living playwright. The wonderfully clear and superbly acted production by the Play Company of this excruciating yet absorbing work is the culmination of the monthlong Tendulkar Festival sponsored by the Indo-American Arts Council. (The festival has included readings, workshops, public discussions and film screenings.) Mr. Tendulkar, 76, has often been embroiled in controversies during his 40 years as a prominent playwright, screenwriter and essayist. Last year, effigies of him were burned in six cities after he spoke out against Narendra Modi, the Hindu chief minister of Gujarat state, where anti-Muslim riots killed more than 2,000 people in 2002. Despite his reputation as a fearless social critic, his plays are not polemical. They are based on merciless character observation and could be described as hypernaturalistic, though some employ nonrealistic conventions. ''Sakharam Binder,'' directed by Maria Mileaf, tells the story of Sakharam's seventh and eighth ''birds'' (as his envious friend Dawood calls Sakharam's women). Laxmi (Anna George) is shy, submissive and pious, whereas Champa (Sarita Choudhury), her successor, is brash, voluptuous and spoiled. Their very different reactions to Sakharam's lordly manner and modest circumstances are sharply and poignantly delineated by Ms. George and Ms. Choudhury. Ms. George projects a steely and oddly moving brittleness as she putters around Sakharam's cramped house, which has no modern amenities and only a single, thin rollup mat for sleeping. Ms. Choudhury radiates a proud, willful acuity that reads as desperate indignation as Champa shirks, malingers and turns to alcohol to blunt her disgust at Sakharam's sexual demands. No one comes off as wholly innocent here. Even the victims prove capable of selfishness and self-deception when their survival is on the line. The play's main conflict is set in motion when Laxmi returns after Sakharam sent her packing, and convinces Champa to let her stay. It's not the plot, however, but the depth and the subtlety of Bernard White's portrayal of Sakharam that injects variety, surprise and fascination into this almost three-hour play. Mr. White vividly captures the strange and complex pathology of Sakharam, who seems to want to please his ''birds'' even as he bullies them and who speaks like a freethinking crusader for women's rights one minute and like an philistine scornful of their devotion to him the next. Sakharam's tragedy turns out to hinge on his budding social consciousness, his arrested enlightenment. He can see -- almost -- an idea of equality and shared humanity that transcends individual appetite, but nothing in his life (including the women) ever encourages him to follow its logic. Like Brecht's Mother Courage, he exploits a corrupt system for personal advantage, then discovers that the price of playing the game is everything he hoped to protect. Unlike Brecht, though, Mr. Tendulkar never judges his protagonist but concentrates instead on painting him with unsettling compassion, perceptiveness and thoroughness. His play deserves to be much better known in the United States than it is. Performances through Nov. 14 at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street.

This warts-and-all perspective differs from documentaries that tend to be infatuated with their subjects, whom they portray as The Other. Either they idealize those under scrutiny as pure, hard-working variations of the noble savage blessed with a rich spiritual life, or they portray their subjects as endangered species in need of protection and preservation. ''Still, the Children Are Here'' does neither. As the film, directed by Dinaz Stafford, wanders around Sadolpara, it finds a society that lives much as its ancestors did for millennia. We watch rainmaking ceremonies and ancient agricultural rituals being re-enacted. But we also sense anxiety and political division as the outside world encroaches. The once self-sufficient Garos are no longer entirely self-sustaining. They raise their own rice to store and to eat, but they also market products, including coal and wood, for cash. Some rare strains of rice that have been cultivated for centuries are threatened with extinction by the economic benefit of high-yield strains. Rigorous crop rotation and the burning of fields (using rotting wood from fallen trees as fertilizer) have kept the soil rich for centuries. But because much of the wood is now harvested and sold rather than left to rot and enrich the land, yields are lower. Diseases, especially tuberculosis, are rampant. And as the Garos trade with the outside world, they are exposed to modern conveniences like electricity and running water. In one scene a committee from the village petitions the provincial government to provide them to the village. But the haphazard structure of the movie, which opens today at Film Forum, is frustrating. It is too light on the history and statistics that might complete the portrait, and too dense with agricultural detail. How connected to the outside world are the Garos? And how long have they been selling wood and coal? The film's personal approach is undermined by its choppy structure. The Garos' domestic and political dramas have little resonance as the film's attention flits arbitrarily from subject to subject. At the beginning of the film we learn that certain scenes were re-enacted by the villagers. But which ones are they, and why? ''Still, the Children Are Here'' ultimately feels like a sampler for the larger more cohesive work you wish it had been. 'Still, the Children Are Here'  Opens today in Manhattan. Directed by Dinaz Stafford; in Garo, with English subtitles; director of photography, Ned Johnston; edited by K.A. Chisolm; music by Nitin Sawhney; produced by Mira Nair; released by First Run/Icarus Films. At the Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village. Running time: 85 minutes.

Viking. $25.95. No one spoke much about welfare and the poor during this election season, and that's a mixed blessing. The reforms passed by the Republican Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996 were successful enough in moving recipients into the work force so that welfare dependency has ceased to be a political issue. But if it is a tribute to reform that politicians no longer run against welfare, it is testimony to the nation's limited concern about poverty that they are also silent about improving what has emerged in the last eight years. For as Jason DeParle shows in this nuanced and compelling book, welfare reform has done a lot less than its backers expected to transform the lives of the poor and to give them, in Mr. Clinton's words, ''a shot at the American Dream.'' Mr. DeParle, a reporter for The New York Times who began covering the urban poor in the 1980's, takes us inside the upheaval in welfare by switching back and forth between two narratives. One is the story of three related black women who move with their children from Chicago to Milwaukee in search of lower rents and higher welfare benefits but then find themselves caught up in the crusade to bring welfare to an end. The other is the story of the politics of welfare reform, featuring Mr. Clinton, Newt Gingrich, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and a supporting cast of policy experts. Mr. DeParle tells both stories in rich detail, mixing in relevant historical background and social research with his own reporting and acknowledging his views without appearing to let them distort his account. Despite initial misgivings about the 1996 legislation, he concludes it brought about important positive changes. And despite evident sympathy for the Milwaukee women, he makes no excuses for their failings. Indeed, he is so even-handed that some readers may miss a unifying message, but the book is as complex as the subject warrants. Of course, the experience of three welfare recipients could never capture the full complexity of the impact of welfare reform. The women's journey, however, has an archetypal character, from their family origins in Mississippi (where the ancestors of two of the three women were slaves on a plantation owned by the forebears of the notorious opponent of civil-rights laws, Senator James O. Eastland) to Chicago (where their hard-working mothers struggled to bring them up, only to see them drop out of school, give birth, and become ''prison widows'' when their babies' fathers went to jail) and finally to Milwaukee, where they help one another as they try to make new lives. Mr. DeParle says he chose Milwaukee as his site for observing the impact of reform because Wisconsin was the epicenter of the welfare-reform earthquake. Sixty-six percent of recipients left welfare in the two years after Tommy G. Thompson, the governor of Wisconsin at the time, established a work requirement under a federal waiver in 1996. Of Mr. DeParle's subjects, two make the transition to low-paid jobs, while an inept system of privatized welfare agencies continues to send checks to the third as she slips deeper into crack addiction. Nationally, the central drama in welfare reform was the antagonistic collaboration of Mr. Clinton and congressional Republicans in enacting the 1996 law. But Mr. Clinton had actually laid the groundwork for an alternative to welfare three years earlier through the expansion of the earned income tax credit, which became the nation's largest -- albeit nearly invisible -- antipoverty program. It was the combination of that credit and new welfare rules that brought about the welfare revolution. Traditionally, only the nonworking poor had received cash assistance, but the money often wasn't enough to live on and many recipients had held jobs they didn't report. Under the new regime, the poor are expected to work, and when they do, they receive a supplement to their wages -- the earned income tax credit -- that is 100 percent federally financed and more substantial than welfare in some states ever provided. In other words, the poor can now do exactly what the old system prohibited: work and receive additional public support to get them out of poverty. What is missing, besides stability of employment, is chiefly health insurance and child care for working mothers in low-paid jobs. The picture that emerges from Mr. DeParle's account is of a reform that was necessary and successful but incomplete. In the four years of high prosperity after 1996, the welfare rolls dropped by 60 percent, while the number of Americans in poverty also fell. In the sluggish economy since 2000, poverty rates have increased, and median family incomes have fallen. Still, there has been no resurgence in welfare, and the poor have done better during an economic downturn than many experts feared. In Mr. DeParle's narrative, the grinding pressures of poverty remain undiminished for the two Milwaukee women who get low-paid jobs. Even small reverses can push them into total destitution, the men in their lives experience little progress, and some of their children seem headed for trouble. Yet Mr. DeParle leaves little doubt that welfare reform, for all its limitations, was the right thing to do. It wasn't only the poor who were stuck on welfare; so were liberals who wanted to reduce poverty but found themselves defending an unpopular program of cash handouts. A new system of work support will not only offer the poor better hope of progress but also be more consonant with American values. But if that system is to be built, the problems of the poor need to get back on the public agenda. Mr. DeParle's book may help focus the discussion.

An actress, playwright and translator, she is 29, Irish and Roman Catholic, a big-boned, cherubic blonde -- a goy! -- with a bachelor's degree in Yiddish literature who speaks English with a hint of lilting brogue and Yiddish with disarming fluency. For an hour and a half on most Wednesday evenings through Dec. 1, Ms. O'Brien can be found in a kindergarten classroom on the sixth floor of the Y, energetically expounding on the wonders of a cultural movement that spawned one Nobel Prize winner (Isaac Bashevis Singer) and a smorgasbord of novelists, playwrights, actors, singers and impresarios but that has often been dismissed by Hebrew-speaking Jews as unsophisticated or lower class. ''The best of Yiddish literature is on par with the best literature all over the world, and yet it still has to be defended,'' Ms. O'Brien gently admonished her audience last Wednesday. Her listeners numbered just a half dozen, including a frail old man in the front row leaning heavily on his walker, but they were rapt. The evening's topic was ''Classics Rewritten for the Yiddish Stage.'' Ms. O'Brien's creamy complexion turned bright pink as she conjured up a vision of the Yiddish theater in Manhattan during its feverish heyday, the 1910's and 1920's, when more than a half-dozen Broadway-size houses, some with 2,000 seats, lined Second Avenue on the Lower East Side. They showed Yiddish versions of ''King Lear'' and ''Hamlet,'' she said, along with more recognizably Jewish fare, with its pungent depictions of everyday life. By the end of her lecture, Ms. O'Brien had aroused as much curiosity about herself as about her material. Pronouncing her ''a treasure,'' one man in the audience wanted to know whether her expertise extended to her native literary tradition as well. In fact, Ms. O'Brien insisted over breakfast the next day at the Edison Cafe, a tattered theater-district hangout known as the Polish tearoom, Irish and Yiddish literature have more in common than one might think. Born in Galway, Ms. O'Brien, whose first name Caraid (pronounced KAH-rid) is the old Irish word for friend, moved to the United States as a 12-year-old when her father, a pathologist, accepted a faculty position at the Boston University School of Medicine. She discovered Yiddish literature as a junior at an all-girls Catholic high school in Hingham, Mass., when she read a novel by Singer for English class. Intrigued, she searched the school library and found books by Singer's brother Israel Joshua, and by Chaim Grade. ''They reminded me of Irish writers, like Patrick Kavanagh, whom my father had read to me,'' she said. ''They were about a world of poverty and life absolutely defined by religion. They shared the same self-deprecating humor.'' Ms. O'Brien was hooked. As an undergraduate at Boston University she designed her own major in Yiddish literature, taking classes at Hebrew College in Brookline, Mass., and with the eminent Yiddishist Ruth Wisse at Harvard. She spent her junior year at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and was among the first non-Jewish students to intern at the National Yiddish Book Center, an organization in Amherst, Mass., that collects and preserves Yiddish books. Her senior thesis was on Grade's memoir, ''My Mother's Sabbath Days,'' which Ms. O'Brien called ''one of my favorite books of all time.'' In the tiny, Yiddish-speaking world, she said, not being Jewish can at times be an advantage. While she has occasionally encountered suspicion -- could she be a missionary working undercover? -- far more often, she said, people seem thrilled by her interest. ''Everyone is interested in the idea of this strapping Irish girl with Yiddish coming out of her mouth,'' Ms. O'Brien said with a smile. ''It gets me into a lot of parties.'' She moved to Manhattan in 1997, planning to become an actor. At one of her first auditions she befriended Aaron Beall, a founder of the New York International Fringe Festival and the Todo Con Nada theater company. Together they saw a production of ''God of Vengeance'' by the Yiddish playwright Sholem Asch. An indictment of religious hypocrisy set in a brothel and featuring a lesbian love scene, the play was shut down on obscenity charges when it was first produced in English in Manhattan in 1922. Ms. O'Brien thought the production she saw was terrible and blamed the translation. ''I told Aaron, 'It's not the play I read.' He said, 'O.K., why don't you translate it? If you do a good translation, I'll direct it.'' A year later, in 1999, Ms. O'Brien appeared as a prostitute in a Todo Con Nada production of the play based on her translation. Staged on the go-go platform at Show World, a former peep show near Times Square, the production -- including Ms. O'Brien's vernacular translation -- was well received. She went on to translate two more plays from what she called ''Asch's underworld trilogy'': ''Motke the Thief'' and ''The Dead Man.'' Along the way, she consulted with Yiddish-speaking mentors, among them the former Second Avenue celebrities Seymour Rexite, known as the Yiddish Frank Sinatra, and Luba Kadison, a stage and movie actress, now 97 and blind. (Mr. Rexite died in 2002, but Ms. O'Brien has a ''standing date'' to see Ms. Kadison every Sunday.) They were among the ambitious Eastern European Jews who helped bring Yiddish drama out of wine gardens and shtetls and turn it into a secular, urban art. In her lecture, Ms. O'Brien also cited Avrom Goldfaden, the rabbinical school dropout who staged the first professional Yiddish theatrical production in Romania in 1876; Boris Thomashefsky, the actor who, as a 16-year-old cigarette factory worker, founded a Yiddish theater on East Fourth Street in the building that is now home to La MaMa; and Jacob Gordin, a socialist playwright and intellectual who helped popularize the nebbishy archetype most famously embodied by Jerry Lewis. Yiddish plays are teeming with sex, crime, incest, adultery, abortion and sacrilege, Ms. O'Brien said. She read a passage in Yiddish from Gordin's Faust play, ''God, Man and Devil'' (1900), in which the devil tempts a man into abandoning his faith by presenting him with a winning lottery ticket. ''I want to give you a sense of what was happening here in the late 1800's and early 1900's, before Eugene O'Neill,'' she told the group. ''These were plays with a social agenda, a political agenda. Even the musicals had social content.'' Lately, Ms. O'Brien has delved into her own heritage for dramatic inspiration. Her play ''The Sandpiper,'' a comedy in verse partly inspired by her paternal grandmother, a traditional Irish storyteller, will be performed -- with Ms. O'Brien playing a role -- at Symphony Space in December. She has also written a novel, ''Pleasurepig,'' as yet unpublished. ''It's my 'Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman,''' she laughed. To make ends meet, she writes theater reviews for the online zine offoffoff.com and works part time as an in-house producer at Symphony Space, where for the last two years she has directed its annual Bloomsday festivities. But she stressed that she had not finished with Yiddish. ''I have a long, long list of plays I'd like to translate,'' Ms. O'Brien said. ''It's hellish work. It makes me want to tear my hair out.

I try to work as fast as I can.''", "title": "A Wee Bit Of Yiddish Wisdom"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/News/U.S./Plains", "Top/Features/Arts", "Top/Features/Books", "Top/Features/Theater", "Top/Features/Theater/News and Features", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Music, Theater and Dance", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Media, Entertainment and Publishing"], "publication_day_of_month": "3", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Arts; Theater; Books", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Wednesday", "print_section": "E", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/03/arts/03cair.html", "print_column": "4", "slug": "03CAIR$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "''Take a chance,'' Kelly Clarkson sings on her new hit single, ''Breakaway.'' ''Make a change and break away.'' But her managers, along with many others who have a stake in the careers of former ''American Idol'' stars like Ms. Clarkson, are not so sure that is a good idea. And as a flood of their albums arrive in stores for the holidays over the next few weeks, the singers are wrestling with how closely to link themselves with the show that made them famous. Starting Nov. 16, the RCA Music Group will deliver five new CD's from former ''Idol'' finalists, including Clay Aiken, Ruben Studdard and the most recent winner, Fantasia Barrino. The glut will again pit the singers against one another, jockeying not for praise from Paula Abdul or Simon Cowell but for limited slots on radio stations and television. Appealing directly to the show's huge audience could stoke sales during a season already thick with offerings from established stars like Eminem, U2, Gwen Stefani and Destiny's Child. But it could also hinder the former contestants' efforts to establish themselves as recording artists with distinctive personalities and the legitimacy needed for long careers. It is a particularly nettlesome issue for the stars of the show's first two seasons -- Ms. Clarkson, Mr. Studdard and Mr. Aiken -- who are releasing albums without the hype of a just-finished television victory behind them. ''We're venturing into brand-new territory here,'' said Tom Ennis, a senior executive at 19 Entertainment, which is the creator and a producer of ''American Idol'' and manages the careers of Ms. Clarkson and Ms. Barrino. Mr. Ennis said he worries that there could be a logjam of ''Idol'' stars trying to land, for example, spots on the same late-night talk shows. But he insisted that the artists should still play up their ties to the show, especially if it means appearing in front of more viewers. Ms. Clarkson, Mr. Studdard and Ms. Barrino all are scheduled to appear on an ''Idol'' holiday special on Fox, to be broadcast on Nov. 24. But Mr. Aiken, who finished as the runner-up in the second season and whose debut album has sold more than those of Ms. Clarkson and Mr. Studdard, is not taking part. Instead, he will have his own holiday television special, Dec. 8 on NBC. Representatives for Mr. Aiken, who has broken from 19's management division, said he was interested in standing apart from the show and would not comment for this article. ''Idol'' has continued to draw a large audience, with little sign of weakening. The show drew an average of 25 million viewers a week in its third season, making it the most-watched show on television. Clive Davis, the music impresario and record executive who oversaw the new albums, said the artists could survive only if they receded from the show's glare. ''We're not having an 'American Idol' marketing campaign,'' Mr. Davis said. He credited the show with energizing the pop field, but said, ''I'm not interested in merely souvenir sales.'' The release of so many albums in such a short period of time stems partly from a collision of agendas. In Ms. Clarkson's case, RCA executives are releasing her CD to try to ride the wave of holiday sales and to capitalize on the popularity of her hit ''Breakaway,'' from the ''Princess Diaries 2'' soundtrack. Mr. Aiken, for his part, was pressed by the label to record a Christmas album. And more generally, RCA has made a habit of releasing albums by the most recent season's finalists at about this time, before viewers have a chance to forget them. For many in the music business, ''Idol'' is the starkest example of how marketing concepts seem to have trumped art. Some analysts have said the show's appeal stems more from the drama of competition and the judges' critiques than it does from the music. Indeed, most of the albums from past contestants stalled on the Billboard album chart, including one by the first season runner-up, Justin Guarini, whose debut sold 140,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan data. RCA has since dropped him. Meanwhile, ''Idol'' spinoffs, including a television series for younger contestants called ''American Juniors,'' have flopped with viewers. On the whole, however, many music executives continue to have faith in the power of television to sell music. Sony BMG Music Entertainment, RCA's corporate parent, struck a deal with Mr. Cowell, in which the company and Mr. Cowell will jointly own his new talent-search show, ''X Factor.'' In their debuts, each of the best-known ''Idol'' contestants outsold bigger names. Ms. Clarkson's first album has sold an estimated 2 million copies, Mr. Studdard's about 1.7 million and Mr. Aiken's about 2.6 million. Mr. Davis estimated that the show's audience accounts for a base of only about 500,000 copies for the top contenders. Success beyond that, particularly for the artists who are releasing their sophomore CD's, hinges more on whether their music connects with a general audience. Mr. Studdard, who won the second season in a close contest with Mr. Aiken, said he was not rushing to step away from the show. ''I know I wouldn't be where I am without it,'' he said. The crowd of coming releases simply ''means we get a chance to saturate the music marketplace with good wholesome music,'' he added. Perhaps the biggest test of the show's continuing clout will be the sales performance of the most recent season's winner, Ms. Barrino, and runner-up, Diana DeGarmo. In keeping with an ''Idol'' custom, they both released debut singles in June, but neither measured up to the previous seasons' stars, whose singles rose to No. 1 on Billboard magazine's singles chart. Rick Krim, executive vice president of music and talent for cable channel VH1, said: ''I don't think it's going to be the phenomenon of when Kelly came out or when Ruben and Clay came out at the same time. I don't quite feel it this time.'' For her part, Ms. Clarkson said label executives and her handlers have spent too much energy hand-wringing over the shadow cast by the show. ''Every time I go into a meeting, it's hilarious,'' she said. ''They're like, 'This is what breaks you away from ''American Idol.''''' First, she said, the apron strings were supposed to have been cut with the success of the debut song from her first album, then with a follow-up song and now with her current hit. ''The only people thinking of it are y'all,'' she said she recalled telling her associates. ''It doesn't matter how you got in the business. It matters how you stay.''", "title": "'Idol' Winners Try Stretching Out Their Fame"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/Features/Arts", "Top/Features/Arts/Music", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Activities and Interests/Music", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Music, Theater and Dance", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Media, Entertainment and Publishing"], "publication_day_of_month": "3", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Arts", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Wednesday", "print_section": "E", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/03/arts/music/03idol.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "03IDOL$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Even at 86, with five botched operations on one hip and a successful one on the other, her eyesight troubling her and her hearing no longer perfect, Muriel Spark is still doing what every writer likes to do. Having just published her 23rd novel, ''The Finishing School'' (Doubleday), she is working on another. True, she admits, she no longer writes quickly. For instance, she completed her 1961 bestseller, ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' in just six weeks. Now she works for three-hour stretches on just three days a week. And a novel, including research, can take her up to a year. But her new one, she noted with quiet satisfaction, ''is going very well indeed.'' It has a title, she explained in a conversation in the hillside Tuscan rectory she has called home for the last 25 years. She will not reveal it, but the title is still the starting point for her writing process. ''It arrives as if by messenger,'' she said. It becomes the seed that grows in the culture of her memory until it takes the form of a new novel. This too occurred with ''The Finishing School,'' where a creative-writing teacher is consumed by jealousy of his star pupil, who at 17 seems destined for glory as a novelist. Ms. Spark has known jealousy -- mainly, she said, as a target of other writers' envy. But as with most of her work, this novel is also rich in humor and keen asides on the absurdity of human behavior. ''The Finishing School'' was well received this spring in Britain, where she is usually described as ''Scotland's greatest living writer.'' In the United States, when it appeared recently, most critics also praised ''Ms. Spark's nasty, cackling plot,'' as the novelist Thomas Mallon put it in The New York Times Book Review. Writing in The New York Times, though, Michiko Kakutani said the novel ''reads more like a parody of a Muriel Spark novel than the real thing.'' By all appearances, Dame Muriel -- she was named a Dame Commander of the British Empire in 1993 -- is not a writer who suffers. She writes by hand, ''and while I write, I invent, the ideas almost flowing through my fingers.'' After her story is typed up by her longtime companion, Penelope Jardine, she makes few corrections. Only once, with ''Territorial Rights,'' did she stop and start afresh. That was 25 years ago. Her self-confidence has a secure base in her long string of popular short novels, dating back to ''The Comforters'' in 1957 and including ''Memento Mori,'' ''The Girls of Slender Means,'' ''The Driver's Seat,'' ''The Abbess of Crewe,'' ''Loitering With Intent'' and ''Aiding and Abetting'' as well as ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' which as a play was a West End and Broadway hit and as a movie won Maggie Smith the 1969 Academy Award for best actress. In reality, Dame Muriel has never lacked confidence. At 14, she was crowned ''Queen of Poetry'' at her high school in Edinburgh. Then at 18, ''in order to write about life as I intended to do,'' she noted in her autobiography, ''Curriculum Vitae,'' ''I felt I had first to live.'' And over the next 15 years, while writing poetry, she did just that -- an unhappy marriage in Southern Rhodesia followed by badly paid jobs in wartime and postwar London. Finally, by 30, she had a repository of memories ready. Her madeleine was Proust. ''It inspired me more than anything,'' she said. ''I wouldn't have wanted to write like Proust, but I could see what you could do with memory. I could see what you could do with incidents. It was after reading Proust that I found that I rather liked writing prose.'' Prose had another attraction: poets usually need jobs; she wanted to write full time. Having edited a review for London's Poetry Society and written speeches for a public relations firm, she won a short-story competition in 1951 and took a part-time job. Still living meagerly, Graham Greene helped by sending her $80 and some wine every month for two years. Then, when her first novel, ''The Comforters,'' was sold in the United States for $1,500, she was finally free. ''It was much nicer to be at home writing my own prose,'' she recalled. Her transformation into a novelist, though, included one other crucial passage: her conversion to Catholicism in 1954. Although her father, Bernard Camberg, was Jewish (Spark is her married name), she was raised a Protestant, eventually choosing Catholicism after studying ''Apologia pro Vita Sua'' by John Henry Cardinal Newman, himself a convert to Catholicism. But unlike Greene, another Catholic convert, Dame Muriel said she had never felt ''this anguish about choice between faith and guilt,'' and was ''very relaxed'' in her attitude toward church doctrine. ''But being a Catholic helped me to become a writer,'' she explained, ''because it settled my mind. I believe strongly in the Holy Spirit and in inspiration.'' ''The form that ideas take has to be something I have experienced,'' she said, sipping a glass of red wine. ''But the idea of writing a particular experience certainly comes from an outside source. I don't see what else it could be.'' Yet while an ''outside force'' may serve as her muse and help her invent her fiction, her own life keeps surfacing, most famously in ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' which was inspired by a much-loved high school teacher, but also in ''The Girls of Slender Means,'' set in a London hostel for ''ladies from good families of modest means,'' much like the Helena Club, where she lived in the late 1940's. When the success of ''Miss Jean Brodie'' began distracting her from her memories, she fled first London, then New York, finally settling in Italy in 1969. ''I was determined to get out all these novels that had mounted up inside me over the years,'' she explained. ''I'd gone through years of poverty, not knowing what to do with all my experiences. I had it all bottled up. I was very anxious in my 40's to express everything that had happened in my 20's and 30's. I simply didn't want to be waylaid.'' ''Loitering With Intent,'' which also took her back to her London of the late 1940's, is, in her view, her most autobiographical novel. The book is narrated as a memory by a young woman who has just completed her first novel and will go on to become famous. In it, the author is clearly speaking for herself when she writes: ''The true novelist, one who understands the work as a continuous poem, is a mythmaker.'' Two decades later, in ''The Finishing School,'' there are echoes of ''Loitering With Intent'' in her exploration of the craft of fiction writing. In her new novel, she transfers her voice to the bumptious student writer. When he is asked if his characters take on a life of their own, he replies, ''No, they live the lives I give them.'' Or as Dame Muriel herself recently said of her characters, ''I'm quite sure that I am in charge.'' Now, however, in what might pass as a mea culpa, she has concluded there are enough novels about writing a novel.

Indie-rock bands often give their love songs whimsical titles, only tangentially related to the lyrics. But Le Tigre is devoted to straightforward rabble-rousing, not sideways leaps. And so ''What's Yr Take on Cassavetes'' was exactly what it said it was: not a sly joke, but a foreshortened argument about the director John Cassavetes. JD Samson shouted, ''Misogynist!'' Kathleen Hanna and Johanna Fateman shouted back, ''Genius!'' And then they chanted the refrain: ''What's your take on Cassavetes? What's your take on Cassavetes?'' A song like that sums up what's appealing about Le Tigre and also what's perplexing. The group's pint-sized drum-machine beats and trebly guitar squalls (the band members often switch instruments) suggest some do-it-yourself variant of new wave, playful but incendiary. And yet the songs are often just as thin as the sounds, with not much room for ambiguity or surprise: you sometimes get the depressing feeling that these three are singing exactly what they mean. The band has within its ranks a marvelous ranter, Ms. Hanna, who finds ways to couple rage with joy, while uncoupling it from menace. (She perfected this style a decade ago with her wildly influential punk band Bikini Kill.) During the anti-Bush harangue ''Seconds,'' she screamed the lyrics (''You make me sick sick sick sick sick sick sick sick sick sick!'') as if she were at a wild -- and single-minded -- party; no doubt she hoped that, 24 hours later, she would be. Le Tigre's new CD is ''This Island'' (Strummer/Universal), the group's major-label debut, and it's something of a disappointment. The trio seems to be bumping up against the limits of its barebones musical formula -- choppy guitar lines over punky dance beats -- and the cover of the Pointer Sisters' 1980's hit ''I'm So Excited'' joylessly hammers the song until it fits the Le Tigre template. The album's first single, ''New Kicks,'' is even more dispiriting: a few guitar chords and a kicky beat, plus samples of antiwar chants and speeches; it could almost be a parody of clunky, dreary agitprop. Still, it's hard not to be amused and encouraged by the idea of a band like Le Tigre recording for a label like Universal, especially since it meant the members had a chance to collaborate with the new-wave guru Ric Ocasek (from the Cars) on ''Tell You Now,'' a fierce but breezy un-love song. The album also finds a few ways to show off the group's most riveting member, Ms. Samson, an icon of nerdy cool who happens to be Le Tigre's most radical sex symbol. On Monday night, she took the microphone for ''Viz.'' ''It's about butch lesbian visibility,'' she explained. The song celebrates a raucous night out. (''They call it coolness, and we call it visibility/They call it way-too-rowdy, we call it finally free.'') But Ms. Samson's voice was cool and androidish, hinting at a hidden world of nightclub debauchery. And listeners could savor the thought that she wasn't singing everything she meant.

Romero, grand master of the undead, was not pleased with the quality of fear showing on a pair of extras, costumed as security guards, in the face of an invading zombie army here last week. ''These guys aren't acting like there's a war going on,'' Mr. Romero moaned, after directing perhaps the 10th take of what should have been a two-take shot. ''Can we rehearse them, please?'' If anyone knows what film terror should look like, it is Mr. Romero. In 1968, he reinvented the horror genre with his ''Night of the Living Dead,'' a cult classic that made its way onto the prestigious National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. His subsequent career had its ups and downs. Of the dozen pictures he later directed, none matched the status of his first, and the last of them, ''Bruiser,'' went straight to video in the United States. Like one of his own unstoppable zombies, however, Mr. Romero, now 65, is back. He is in Toronto directing a fourth installment of his ''Living Dead'' series, called ''Land of the Dead. '' And with support from Universal Pictures, he is riding a wave partly of his own making. Horror films in general, and zombie flicks in particular, are in vogue at the moment. In the past year alone, four medium- to low-budget zombie movies -- Zack Snyder's remake of Mr. Romero's 1978 ''Dawn of the Dead'' for Universal, the zombie spoof ''Shaun of the Dead'' (Focus Features), ''28 Days Later'' (Fox Searchlight) and ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' (Sony Pictures) -- have taken in more than $165 million at the North American box office. In the last two weeks, Sarah Michelle Gellar's unheralded horror movie ''The Grudge'' has taken in $71 million for Columbia Pictures, while ''Saw'' (Lions Gate), another relatively inexpensive bloodfest, had more than $17 million in ticket sales last weekend. Sequels to both ''Saw'' and ''28 Days Later'' have already been announced, and at least two other zombie movies, including a Dutch-produced film featuring Nazi undead, are in the works. A tall, shaggy bear of a man with a beard, ponytail and oversize, square black glasses, Mr. Romero believes the current revival says more about Hollywood than the culture at large. ''If one horror film hits,'' he said in an interview, ''everyone says, 'Let's go make a horror film.' It's the genre that never dies.'' In addition, he said, he thinks the ''Resident Evil'' video games ''woke everyone up.'' But others see larger forces at work. John Leguizamo, who co-stars in ''Land of the Dead'' with Dennis Hopper, Simon Baker and Asia Argento, said he believed the renewed popularity of horror ''has to do with our times, when things are unsure, and there's so much violence in places like Iraq.'' Indeed, Mr. Romero -- who spoofed consumer culture in ''Dawn of the Dead'' and informed the original ''Night of the Living Dead'' with eerie echoes of the Vietnam War and 60's racial violence -- consciously redesigned his new film to accommodate post-9/11 fears about terrorism, after studios rejected his initial script as too downbeat in the immediate aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks. ''The idea of living with terrorism -- I've tried to make it more applicable to the concerns Americans are going through now,'' Mr. Romero said. The reworked script immediately attracted attention from 20th Century Fox. But negotiations dragged on for a year, until the producer Mark Canton had lunch with Mr. Romero's agent and asked about the director. ''After all these decades, he has figured out the final story in the zombie marathon,'' Mr. Canton recalls being told. ''I read the script, and said I wanted to do it. As soon as the news got out, Universal called me right away. They were on fire about it. It came together that fast.'' The deal, in fact, was sealed in one month, with Universal retaining distribution rights on the $15 million picture. In the new story, Mr. Romero said, ''the fat cats live'' in a high-security complex called Fiddler's Green, which the director is conjuring inside BCE Place, an indoor office and shopping mall here with a futuristic, vaulted ceiling that makes it look like a true cathedral of commerce. On the outside, zombie hordes roam almost unimpeded throughout the earth. ''People are aware of what's going on outside,'' Mr. Romero said, ''and they're willing to listen to a government entity calling Fiddler's Green a safe haven, but it's not really providing everything they need. So some of the protagonists have to go out into the real world to get things like food -- and deodorant.'' As Mr. Romero's first ''undead'' film in 20 years, ''Land of the Dead,'' which will most likely be released next summer, is already mobilizing a fan base that has been hungering for the director's special brand of bloodshed. Anticipation, said Tony Timpone, editor of the horror magazine Fangoria, is ''extremely high.'' ''All the other zombie films are just a warmup for Romero's zombie film,'' Mr. Timpone said. ''George is the godfather of the zombie movie.'' At 2 a.m., ''lunch time'' on the 12th of 33 consecutive night shoots, Mr. Romero's immediate concern over the lackluster security guards has been solved: he has decided to eliminate the shot, to cut instead to zombies breaking the windows of Fiddler's Green, and then cut back to an interior shot of civilians and security personnel fleeing from the rampaging undead. As for future prospects, Mr. Romero was reasonably upbeat. ''Will this be a calling card?'' he said. ''It might be.'' ''If this film opens big, the phone's going to be ringing off the hook -- not necessarily for the right stuff, though,'' said Mr. Romero, who says he has turned down his share of projects about ''guys with hockey masks and knives.''

The latest televised exercise in British-American sadism comes tonight in the form of ''Nanny 911,'' Fox's latest reality program, on which infantile American families are abused by prim, nasty nannies from Britain -- and end up begging for more. On tonight's episode, Karen and Matt Rock, the wishy-washy parents of Dylan, 4, and Natalie, 2, preside dimwittedly over domestic anarchy. Deafening wails come from every corner of their miserable Southern California house. The children spend their days shrieking, punching and collapsing into bag-of-bones poses of passive resistance. When Karen's or Matt's attention strays from Dylan for even a second, he screams: ''I don't love you! I don't love you!'' Nanny Deb to the rescue. Cited by the head nanny, Lillian, for her ''determined and happy nature,'' Deb, who has been a nanny for 20 years, is assigned to cure the Rocks. (In the show's conceit, Lillian oversees a coven of nannies in what looks like an English cottage; it is not clear where in the world the cottage actually is.) Having seen a video of the unruly Rocks, Deb hears the call and jumps into action in a red woolen cape and cap -- awkward garments, especially in Southern California, though they must say ''nanny'' to someone. On the first day, Nanny -- the Rocks call her Nanny -- tells the family she will simply observe, and she does, albeit with a good deal of sighing and note-taking. Karen admits she is intimidated. Indeed, Nanny's glasses, which are heavily framed with a scary librarian chain, are daunting, though later she seems a little looser, less indomitable -- more American, even -- than her appearance at first suggests. When she begins to intervene, she calls the Rocks ''you guys,'' and uses child-rearing slang, like ''not O.K.'' Nanny's initial observations confirm what viewers have seen in the set-up: the Rocks are bad parents. Karen still sleeps with her 4-year-old; Matt tries to hide out at work as late as possible; and the children are virtually never disciplined. Nanny institutes four house maxims that come as a revelation to the Rocks: Respect one another; every action has a consequence; ''I want'' does not get; and hands are not for hitting. So far, so good. All the ''Nanny 911'' needs now are parables during which the magic of the rules can be demonstrated, and the show obligingly provides them. It is commendable that shows like this one, which might be compared with ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy'' or ''What Not to Wear,'' are so tightly organized. They formally enact the lesson they explicitly mean to teach: structure is everything. Fox has tapped into an idea with potential here. The ''before'' images of screaming, squirming children are not just dramatic, they are aggravating on an animal level. You want the racket to stop. But if you like a story, you also want the quiet to be well won. (Ritalin is not dispensed on this show.) The fact that the formulaic lessons of the show are telegraphed early on does not pre-empt suspense over whether they will be applied and how, or who, will learn them first. Just as fans of ''The Apprentice'' like to synch up their business instincts with the revelations of the show, viewers here will want to match wits with the nannies on the subject of parenthood. So the Rocks learn to respect one another, more or less, and Dylan and Natalie get shut in their rooms when they shriek and whine and ignore all requests. Matt turns out to have a knack for discipline, and Karen at length backs off and lets her husband run his game. At last, she even moves back into the master bedroom, leaving Dylan to fend for himself, which he proudly does. Dylan, who seems irreparably crazy at the top of the hour, mellows out. By the show's end, everyone seems sane and quiet, even loving. Only then does noble, if lonesome, Nanny go on her way. 'Nanny 911'  Fox, tonight at 9, Eastern and Pacific times; 8, Central time.

''Genius Loves Company,'' an album of Ray Charles duets that Starbucks' Hear Music division released in late summer as a joint venture with the independent label Concord Records, remained in the Billboard Top 10 for more than a month and recently went platinum. More than a quarter of the CD's sales were made in Starbucks coffee shops. Hear, a retailer and label that Starbucks bought five years ago, introduced a satellite radio channel in October that focuses on the kind of adult-oriented pop that Starbucks features. And last month Starbucks announced a plan to install a computer system in some of its United States locations that would let customers make a customized CD that could be assembled, packaged and purchased while they wait for drinks. Like all that chain's music ventures, the ''Genius Loves Company'' album and the decision to sell customized CD's grew out of the belief that Starbucks regulars -- mostly 25-to-49-year-olds with the kind of disposable income that allows them to spend up to several dollars for coffee or tea a few times a week -- are poorly served by radio stations and record stores attuned to teenage tastes. At a time when Starbucks contends that its customers don't have convenient ways to find out about undiscovered artists, ''we feel we have the opportunity to present the individual with a new option,'' Ken Lombard, president of Starbucks Entertainment, said. In presenting those options, Starbucks is catering to its core customers. ''We do not want to be in the Britney Spears business,'' Starbucks' chairman, Howard Schultz, said. Unlike most record stores, Starbucks has a merchandising strategy to sell an experience along with a product. And as in its coffee business, it is so far enjoying the margins that go with that: most albums at Starbucks sell for more than $15 each, while many traditional music outlets are under pressure to cut CD prices. Mr. Schultz said he believed that the chain's music ventures would become profitable, but it might be more difficult for Starbucks to establish itself in the digital music business than to spotlight a few individual CD's. So far, its efforts to sell items other than coffee have had mixed results. In 2000 Starbucks took a $20.6 million charge from its investment in living.com, a lifestyle portal, and it no longer offers as many lifestyle items in stores as it did around that time. Major labels are sufficiently intrigued with Starbucks' custom CD venture to allow it to sell some of the music from their catalogs on a song-by-song basis, much as iTunes does. ''I would think it's going to give us an opportunity with adult buyers,'' said Phil Quartararo, president of EMI Music Marketing. At least partly because many adults have not embraced downloading en masse, they represent a group that record companies have become more interested in, as well as one that some industry executives believe is not enamored with many CD stores. Rather than lure customers from standard record shops, Mr. Quartararo said he hoped Starbucks -- and perhaps in the future, other such lifestyle retailers -- would generate more sales among casual music fans disinclined to enter record stores, which they perceive as overwhelming. By giving space near the register to a few CD's, Starbucks essentially makes recommendations to a specific audience. ''It puts the music in front of the right customer and makes it convenient to get,'' said Glen Barros, president of Concord. ''I think it's potentially a big deal, but I don't see it as hugely competitive so much as something that could expand the pie'' of music sold, said Mike Dreese, co-owner of Newbury Comics, a chain of 24 record stores in New England. ''Starbucks has the potential to reach millions of disaffected music consumers. They have a decent brand and a history of promoting moderately interesting music collections.'' That has been a cornerstone of Starbucks' music strategy from the beginning. In 1999 Starbucks spent $8 million to acquire Hear Music, then a San Francisco-based label and music retailer founded by Don MacKinnon, now a vice president of Starbucks Entertainment. By the late 90's, many clothing and lifestyle retailers, from Pottery Barn to Banana Republic, were selling compilation CD's. But Mr. MacKinnon helped move Starbucks beyond basic early efforts like ''Blue Note Blend,'' a collection of tracks from that jazz label. In 2002 Hear Music introduced its ''Artist's Choice'' series of compilations of favorite tracks selected by performers such as Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash and the Rolling Stones. ''It's a way for people to say, 'I like this artist, let's see what they picked,''' said Emmylou Harris, who said she participated in the project as a way to introduce a mass audience to lesser-known artists she enjoyed, like Gillian Welch and Guy Clark. The CD's offered by Starbucks have benefited from countertop placement as well as in-store play. As of Oct. 18, when Starbucks began the customized CD system in three Seattle stores, the chain began competing with iTunes and other big names in digital music. By the end of this year there is expected to be 15 such systems in Starbucks' Seattle stores and 30 more in Austin, Tex. Initially, Starbucks will face the task of trying to sell customized CD's to an age group that has not embraced downloading. But the company is well positioned to move beyond customized CD's, because more than 3,000 of its stores offer wireless Internet access, which could be used to download music files. As record labels are trying to prevent the availability of online free music from undermining the value of their CD's, they might take a cue from a retailer with a track record of providing a pricey alternative to a widely available product. ''Starbucks is a branding machine,'' Mr. Quartararo said. ''Nobody buys a 40-cent cup of coffee for $4 unless they're buying a brand.''", "title": "Would You Like an Extra Shot of Music With That Macchiato?"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/Features/Arts", "Top/Features/Arts/Music", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Marketing, Advertising and PR", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Activities and Interests/Music", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Music, Theater and Dance"], "publication_day_of_month": "3", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Arts", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "print_page_number": "3", "publication_day_of_week": "Wednesday", "print_section": "E", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/03/arts/music/03buck.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "03BUCK$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "In the latest jousting between China and Japan over Russia's energy riches, China is talking with the Exxon Mobil Corporation about buying gas from the Sakhalin Island field, which many Japanese assumed would power their nation for decades to come. The gas talks come as China rues its loss of a Siberian oil pipeline that was once promised to run to Manchuria. Instead, Russian officials made clear this fall that the pipeline would go to a Russian port on the Sea of Japan. Russian leaders changed their minds after Japan's government offered billions of dollars to help finance the pipeline, which could be a $12 billion, 2,500-mile oil project running from Lake Baikal to Nakhodka. On a third energy front, a stalemate emerged last week in Beijing after two days of talks between China and Japan over a Chinese gas exploration project in the East China Sea. With China drilling near an area claimed by Japan, Japan fears that the Chinese gas wells will suck up Japanese gas from a reservoir that straddles the border. While these hydrocarbons have been around for millions of years, disputes are suddenly coming into sharp focus with oil selling at $50 a barrel and China's oil imports leaping. In the first half of this year, oil imports by China, the world's second-largest oil consumer after the United States, jumped 40 percent. Asia is witnessing ''an increasingly fierce competition between the two countries for access to energy supplies,'' John E. Carbaugh Jr., a Washington consultant who was once chief of staff to Senator Jesse Helms, wrote in his newsletter, Daily Report. ''Japan, the world's second-largest economy, has long been dependent on foreign supplies of energy while China's own appetite has surged in recent years along with its economy,'' he wrote last week from Washington. ''Both countries also have their gaze fixed on the resource-rich hinterlands of Russia as an important new source of energy and are currently locked in a high-stakes rivalry to secure access.'' On Tuesday, many Japanese were shocked to learn that Lee R. Raymond, Exxon Mobil's chairman, sketched out the Chinese option during a meeting here Monday with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Shoichi Nakagawa, minister of economy, trade and industry. Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported Tuesday that Exxon Mobil, which owns 30 percent of the project and is its lead investor, was in talks to sell ''the total volume'' to the China Natural Gas Public Corporation. Hoping for a deal by next spring, Exxon Mobil would send the gas by pipeline to Russia's mainland and from there to China. Japanese companies own 30 percent of the Sakhalin 1 project and Japanese officials long assumed that the gas would eventually make its way here. With reserves estimated at 485 billion cubic meters, the Exxon Mobil gas reserves are the equivalent of six years of Japan's total gas demand. Selling the gas to China would represent a radical turn for the project, and Mr. Nakagawa assured reporters at a news conference Tuesday that the talks did ''not mean Exxon Mobil picked China.'' But with the consortium planning to ship gas in 2008, Exxon Mobil officials have complained that Japan has not taken steps toward building a 930-mile undersea pipeline from Sakhalin to Japan. The Tokyo Electric Power Company, Japan's biggest buyer of liquefied natural gas, has been noncommittal about locking itself into a long-term fixed contract for piped gas. A pipeline along the seabed is not expected to create much environmental damage, but every Japanese fishermen's union along the route has made clear that it expects advance compensation payments. ''Most of the problems have been on the Japan side, the problem of getting a customer for such large volumes, the fishermen issue,'' Philip Vorobyov, a Russian energy expert for Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said Tuesday by telephone from Moscow. ''Hardly anything has been done on the Japanese side to get this gas. It is natural to talk to another consumer if the one you are talking to is not budging.'' The Chinese alternative has its pluses and minuses. By bringing gas through the Russian Far East, Transneft, the Russian pipeline monopoly, would follow President Vladimir V. Putin's policy of stressing internal development over exports of raw materials. Some gas could be used for fertilizer production or to generate electricity. The rest could be exported to Manchuria. Northeast China, however, is currently the nation's rust belt, a region with an energy surplus and virtually no capacity for handling piped gas. A third option would be to send the gas by pipeline down the length of Sakhalin Island to Prigorodnoye, where the Sakhalin energy consortium is building a liquefied natural gas processing plant. Space is being put aside to build a section to handle gas from Exxon's field, creating a product that could be inserted into Japan's distribution system. The projects have attracted a total of $22 billion in investment. A gas pipeline to China may provide a way for Russia to soften the blow of building an oil pipeline that would roughly follow the Trans-Siberian Railroad, bypassing China. After years of talk, ''a decision on construction of the eastern pipeline'' will come by Dec. 15, Arkady Dvorkor, an adviser to President Putin, told Reuters in Moscow on Tuesday. The decision about building the pipeline should be taken in the shortest possible time. With China expected to surpass Japan in a few years as the world's second-largest oil importer, after the United States, more bruising battles over energy are expected. China is building 23 gas-fired power plants, with 16 more planned. ''China's quest for energy security is indeed beyond its borders,'' Wenran Jiang, a professor at the University of Alberta, wrote in a recent article published by the Jamestown Foundation. ''Beijing's growing prominence and its competition for energy has alarmed Washington and Tokyo and caused long-term strategic adjustments in all the three capitals.''", "title": "China and Japan Jockey For Share of Russian Gas"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/Business", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/China", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Japan", "Top/News", "Top/News/World/Asia Pacific", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia/China", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia/Japan"], "publication_day_of_month": "3", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Business", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Business/Financial Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Wednesday", "print_section": "W", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/03/business/worldbusiness/03gas.html", "print_column": "5", "slug": "03GAS$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Like a Japanese compact car, the nation's economy is built to go a long way on a little gas. And so, Japan should be one of the best-prepared countries in the world to deal with rising oil prices. But as oil prices linger around $50 a barrel, economists now say Japan may be among the hardest hit. The Japanese economy depends less on oil than almost any nation, requiring only about half as much oil to generate $1 worth of economic growth as the United States. But while the surge in oil prices has had relatively little impact so far on corporate profits or consumer spending, the increase is beginning to take a toll on the economy by contributing to a decline in Japanese exports, the main engine of the recovery that began last year. As a result, the pace of economic growth in Japan has slowed sharply from earlier this year raising concerns about the durability of the recovery. ''We are seeing the obvious impact of higher oil prices, which are pushing down the trade surplus,'' said Shuji Shirota, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Tokyo. ''The rise is already affecting the Japanese economy.'' Mr. Shirota recently cut his forecast for growth in Japan's gross domestic for 2005 to 0.9 percent from an earlier estimate of 1.1 percent, mostly because of the damage he expects higher oil prices will do to exports. The oil prices have not yet shown up in overall growth figures for 2004. The situation highlights the extent to which Japan's recovery continues to rely on overseas markets and remains vulnerable to economic conditions abroad. Exports account for less than 15 percent of the economy. But consumer spending, which accounts for about 60 percent of the Japanese economy, has been flat or falling amid a steady decline in incomes, and many economists do not expect a rebound in incomes or consumption anytime soon. Japan's economy grew at an annual pace of 1.3 percent for the second quarter of this year after expanding at a robust 6.4 percent in the first quarter, largely because of strong growth in exports of everything from cars and computers to DVD players and digital cameras. But more recently, economists say, demand for many of those goods appears to be softening. Experts cite a variety of reasons, including some slowing in China, but at the top of their lists is the rise in oil prices. Japanese exports have fallen in three of the last four months, in seasonally adjusted terms. Figures released in late October showed that exports sank a seasonally adjusted 2.3 percent in September from August while the oil price increase pushed the value of imports up 2.5 percent. Over all, Japan's trade surplus sank a seasonally adjusted 21.8 percent in September from a month earlier, to 816.4 billion yen ($7.7 billion). After months of largely dismissing the threat of rising fuel prices, Japan's policy makers are now warning that they consider the increase a threat to the recovery. The economics minister, Heizo Takenaka, said recently that a prolonged rise in oil prices was now the ''biggest risk'' facing the Japanese economy. With few natural resources, Japan imports nearly all of its oil. But the country has also worked hard to reduce its oil consumption, especially after supply shocks in the 1970's raised worries about the country's near total reliance on foreign oil. Now, about one-third of Japan's electricity is generated by nuclear reactors, and the country hopes to raise that ratio to 40 percent by 2010. At the same time, the popularity of small fuel-efficient cars and a well-developed and widely used public transportation network mean that spending on gasoline accounts for only about 1.2 percent of the average Japanese consumer's budget, compared with about 3 percent for the average American, according to Mizuho Securities. So, even though prices at the pump have risen in Japan this year just as they have in the United States, the rise does not have as big an impact on Japanese spending habits. And because of the heavy concentration of high-technology companies, like Canon, Sharp and Sony, Japan's manufacturers depend less on oil than do those in its Asian neighbors, like South Korea, where shipbuilding and other heavy manufacturing make up a relatively large part of the economy. ''The dynamics of the Japanese recovery are still such that it begins with export growth,'' says Ryo Hino, an economist at J.P. Morgan Chase. Mr. Hino recently cut his forecast for growth in the Japanese economy in 2005 to 2.2 percent from 2.5 percent because of the rise in oil prices. Despite Japan's efficient use of oil, he said, the country will not be immune from the effect of rising prices. ''You're clearly seeing signs of softness in global demand growth, and Japan seems to be the one that's really slowing the most,'' he said.", "title": "Japan's Recovery Hinges on Oil Prices"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/Business", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Japan", "Top/News", "Top/News/World/Asia Pacific", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia/Japan", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia/Japan/Tokyo"], "publication_day_of_month": "3", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Business", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Business/Financial Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Wednesday", "print_section": "W", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/03/business/worldbusiness/03japanoil.html", "print_column": "4", "slug": "03JAPA$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "At a rugby game at Middlebury College recently, cheerleaders had taken the field to urge on the home team with timeless perkiness when they were silenced by a drove of naked students running a parade line through the middle of the field. At Connecticut College, a tour of the campus was conducted in the typical formation, with the guide walking backward, pointing to everything from the library to the dean's office. The only wrinkle was that those taking the tour, both men and women, were without a stitch of clothes. Both proved victories under the belt of a team that doesn't wear any. At colleges across New England and upstate New York, a band of naked students from Hamilton College, who call themselves the school's varsity streaking team (and consider themselves undefeated and ranked No. 1 in the nation, though it is not clear -- or even probable -- that there is any competition), has been spotted tiptoeing through college libraries stark naked, forefingers on noses, advising people to shush and running down campus hills in a Flying V formation, also naked, flapping their arms and making ''caw'' noises. Proudly describing themselves as more narcissists than naturalists, the streakers, most of whom say they are on the fringes of campus life and washouts from youth athletic programs, are not authorized in any way by Hamilton College or the N.C.A.A., and they obviously do not have the more common trappings of team play, like uniforms. All they come equipped with is deadpan humor and sneakers. Theater of the absurd, meet intercollegiate sports. The streaking at Hamilton started several years ago, but it was a more loosely aligned group that did most of its streaking on campus, generally during school events. But at some point in the last year -- no one is sure precisely when -- they had a collective brainstorm. ''We kept referring to ourselves as a team,'' said Craig Moores, a senior studio arts major, ''and then it dawned on us that if we were truly a team, we'd have to have away games.'' What constitutes victory when they play other colleges is open to some discussion. Pete Holzaepfel, a lanky and affable senior government major with political ambitions, said that on the one hand, if a member of the other school joins them in streaking, Hamilton loses, or at best plays to a draw. On the other hand, he added, he has ambivalence about this as an accurate measurement of performance, because as they streak they shout to encourage others to join in. Matthew Himmel, a biology major in his senior year, said the essential element of a victorious streak is that it be done in front of a lot of people. ''After all, if no one saw you, did you, in fact, streak?'' As eager as the team was to test its mettle at other schools, some of the roughly two dozen members admit that they went the route of intercollegiate sports only because streaking at Hamilton had grown stale. Alex Klivecka, a junior majoring in religious studies, said that even when he ran in a mask, people on the school's paths were greeting him by name. The team members still streak their own campus on special occasions, but their focus has turned outward. The team spent fall break in early October together in a 30-foot recreational vehicle, streaking at all the schools in Hamilton's athletic league, the New England Small College Athletic Conference. Three team members were detained by the police at Wellesley, but they have not yet been charged. ''They kept asking us what cause we were streaking for,'' said Mr. Moores, ''so we finally had to start throwing some causes out there, but look -- we're just not nudists for Nader.'' As with varsity football teams and even the marching band, an away game offers the opportunity for team members to bond on the road. Mr. Holzaepfel, who said he had a creeping feeling that this is just the sort of youthful discretion that will get him in trouble on a future campaign trail, is currently trying, with his teammates, to formulate some sort of catch-all to explain away his actions. Sean Tice, a junior who is majoring in both English and religious studies, said that talk also circled toward how philosophers like Heidegger might interpret their acts before coming to the realization that harnessing Heidegger to naked sprints in public seems, at best, a reach. Said Mr. Tice: ''It's just getting an adrenaline rush without having to play two and a half hours of sports.'' Lauren Thomsen, who started streaking only this year, as a senior, concurred. She said she was more than hesitant at first, though intrigued, and figured that in her last year and with a career in architecture, not politics, in front of her, she had little to lose and a liberating feeling to gain. The team starts by arriving on campus and formulating a plan of attack while fully clothed, disguised as that school's students. At Colgate recently, they first figured that they would run through the main portion of campus, and two floors of the student center, before going into the woods to undress. Mr. Holzaepfel gave the team a pregame talk, though it was a short and modest one. The team was fearful of being caught, not to mention somewhat chilly. Off they went, imploring Colgate students to strip (none did), and then back to their cars, which, as bad luck would have it, were parked in a lot next to a building where Colgate's president was holding a meeting. ''We've done a lot of bad planning historically,'' said Lydia Kiesling, a senior comparative literature major. ''That's usually the X-factor.'' The team was hemmed into the parking lot by three campus security vehicles, backed by the Hamilton Village police. Andy Glossner, a junior chemistry major, looked ashen. If this police matter delayed him, he would miss an exam in physical chemistry, he wailed. ''Physical chemistry?'' repeated Ms. Kiesling. ''As opposed to what, mental chemistry?'' Jeff Verry, one of the campus security officers, was on his first day on the job. One gets the sense that if it were up to him, the streakers would go free. ''It was probably a bad judgment call,'' he said, ''but you are only young once.'' Another security officer offered paternal advice. ''Next time,'' he told them, ''think before you act.'' ''That's the problem,'' answered one of the streakers, ''we did.'' Then the Hamilton Village police charged everyone with disorderly conduct.

There was this guidance counselor at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, a woman named Kornhaber, and she wore a blond wig. And when Shivani was a junior or senior there in the late 1990's, she heard all the whispers from her classmates about the reason. Mrs. Kornhaber was bald. No, Mrs. Kornhaber had cancer. The counselor looked pretty healthy and normal to Shivani, though. She had a different idea, a vague sense that the wig had something to do with the fact Mrs. Kornhaber was Jewish. Not that Shivani knew much about Jews. She was as an immigrant from Guyana of Indian ancestry, a resident of a mostly Latino neighborhood along the Grand Concourse, a neighborhood that hadn't been Jewish for 40 years, more than twice as long as Shivani had been alive. That question about the wig, that stray bit of curiosity, kept rattling around Shivani's brain as she entered City College and took up a major in psychology. So last winter, having finished most of her required classes, she finally indulged the wonderment and registered for a course in Jewish studies on films about the Holocaust. Intrigued and affected by that introduction, she interned for academic credit over the summer with the Jewish Community Relations Council. Then, this fall, she signed up for classes in Holocaust history and Jewish life in New York. There she learned that Mrs. Kornhaber wore the wig in compliance with Jewish religious law instructing that a married woman not show her real hair to any man except her husband. Along the way, Shivani declared a second major in Jewish studies. To fulfill it, she will take no less than four Jewish studies classes next spring, her final semester. ''People ask me all the time: 'Are you Jewish? Where are you from?''' she said after class one day last week. ''And I tell them it's not about being Jewish. It's about exploration.'' Her exploration typifies a striking trend at City College and in Jewish studies nationally -- its appeal to gentiles. Of the 250 students enrolled in Jewish studies classes at City College, 26 of them majoring and 160 minoring in the field, some 95 percent are not Jewish, according to Prof. Roy Mittelman, the director of the program. The more than 100 colleges and universities offering Jewish studies include such Catholic institutions as Fordham and Scranton, the Quaker-based Earlham College in Indiana, and public ones like the University of Kentucky and Portland State in Oregon that are far from any sizable Jewish community. This explosion in Jewish studies, a discipline that barely existed 35 years ago, reflects a confluence of forces: the roots-consciousness that gave rise to all sorts of ethnic studies programs in the late 1960's; the emergence of Jewish family foundations eager to endow the programs; and the growing popularity of Jewish parochial schools covering the elementary and secondary grades. At the outset, at least, Jewish studies was by Jews, about Jews, for Jews. ''No. 1 was the desire to reach Jewish kids,'' said Judith Baskin, the president of the Association for Jewish Studies, which has 1,500 professors and graduate students as members. ''No. 2 was to demonstrate that Jewish studies has a place in the academic curriculum as part of Western civilization. No. 3 was that it would increase tolerance if non-Jewish students learn about the Jewish experience.'' The recent fascination of gentiles with Jewish studies, then, arrived as a pleasant, and wholly unexpected, shock. Nowhere does this phenomenon carry greater historical resonance than at City College, an institution deeply intertwined with the history of American Jewry. In the decades before World War II, when many elite universities held quotas on Jewish students, City became known as ''the poor man's Harvard,'' the launching pad for intellectuals like Irving Howe and Irving Kristol. By the 1980's, with Jews now flocking to the colleges that formerly had barred them and City College a predominantly nonwhite school, it suffered national notoriety for the anti-Semitic diatribes of Leonard Jeffries, a tenured professor of black studies. THE success of Professor Mittelman's program represents a third wave, part of the overall resurgence of City College. While the Jewish studies courses do attract a few Jews, most of them immigrants from the former Soviet Union, they overwhelmingly draw those self-described explorers like Shivani Subryan. ALONGSIDE her in Rabbi Bob Kaplan's class on Jewish life in New York on a recent morning sat immigrants from Colombia, Slovakia, South Korea and the Dominican Republic. As they discussed Jewish poverty on the Lower East Side, Jewish disapproval of interfaith marriage and the struggle to learn English, as depicted in Leo Rosten's novel ''The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N,'' they were by inference learning about their own generation of new Americans. ''The kids see Jews as a successful immigrant group and are interested in what happened,'' Rabbi Kaplan said. ''I always get asked, 'How did you guys do it?''' More than pragmatism alone, though, has brought non-Jews into the classes, which range in content from theology to history to film and literature. Ardent Christians such as Jichan Kim, an immigrant from South Korea, and Jameelah Lewis, an African-American raised in Ohio, came seeking the Judaic roots of their faith and their savior. Kebba Jallow, an immigrant from Gambia, was motivated paradoxically by having heard so many anti-Jewish slurs in America. ''I had a weird curiosity because I'd accepted all those ideas -- Jews are cheap, Jews are always whining about the Holocaust,'' he recalled. ''I didn't have the knowledge to contest it. The classes redefined the stereotypes for me. They were just an eye-opener.'' Sinia Randolph, a history major from Harlem, interviewed an aging survivor as part of her research for Professor Mittelman's class in the Holocaust. The experience changed her way of viewing the tragedies of Jews and African-Americans, which all too often have served as the basis of an invidious game of genocide one-upmanship. ''I know that a lot of time African-Americans think slavery was worst, and maybe deep down I did,'' she said. ''I mean I knew of Hitler and the six million, but that was as far as it went. Coming into this class, I've realized that the suffering is the same. The same inhumanity. The same cruelty.''

He was 82. Lord Hanson built his business reputation as the creator of one of Britain's richest conglomerates, Hanson Trust, with companies whose products included cigarettes, bricks and batteries. At the height of his deal-making renown in the 1980's, Lord Hanson, a confidant of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, became an emblem of no-holds-barred capitalism. While investors praised his business acumen and decisiveness, adversaries said he acquired companies only to sell off their component parts at a profit. ''Hanson was like an antique dealer, buying slightly dingy assets, polishing them up and putting them back in the shop window,'' The Times of London said on Tuesday. In many ways, he came to symbolize the corporate Britain that flourished under Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative government in the 1980's. Like her, he was a fierce proponent of private ownership, was deeply skeptical about Britain's relationship with the European Union and opposed British adoption of the euro single currency. Tall and well groomed, he was known in his younger days as the socialite companion of a series of glamorous women, including Joan Collins and Audrey Hepburn, to whom he was engaged until she canceled the wedding in 1952. In 1959, he married an American, Geraldine Kaelin, who died last February after 45 years of marriage. He is survived by two sons, Robert and Brook, and a stepdaughter, Karyn. Lord Hanson ran his empire in close consultation with a small group of loyal advisers. Long before globalization became a mantra, he acquired companies employing 90,000 people in Britain, Australia and the United States. His longtime business associate, Lord White, who died in 1995, was once asked about their longstanding business presence in the United States. He is said to have replied: ''At the start of the Second World War, Britain owned more than 30 percent of U.S. Inc. and it would be rather nice to get that back.'' The company's success in the United States prompted it to describe itself in Britain as ''the company from over here that is doing rather well over there.'' Lord White was widely seen as the buccaneering initiator of many of the biggest deals undertaken by Hanson Trust. Between them the two men started by buying relatively small, nondescript industrial companies before moving on to acquire gold fields, coal mines, brick works and chemical plants. Only in the 1990's, when investors' appetites swung away from conglomerates and toward companies with simpler, more transparent structures, was Lord Hanson obliged to break up his empire into four smaller, publicly traded units. At that time, in 1996, his companies had combined annual sales estimated at $18 billion. Lord Hanson's personal wealth was estimated at between $100 million and $200 million. He retired in 1997 and had been suffering for several years from prostate cancer. James Edward Hanson was born on Jan. 20, 1922, at Huddersfield in Yorkshire, where his father, Robert, ran a successful transport company. He left England for Canada after World War II but returned in 1963 and began a partnership with Lord White, then Gordon White, when the two men were board members of a truck dealership. They bought a string of businesses in the 1960's and 1970's, but were best remembered for a series of megadeals in the 1980's. In 1986, their company acquired the SCM Corporation, a typewriter and chemical company in the United States, for $930 million. In the same year, the Hanson company paid $2.5 billion for Imperial Group, a food and tobacco company in Britain. But investors began to doubt the company's ability to sustain its money-making run when the Hanson company lost a bitter battle for Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries in 1991. Investors also came to challenge the opacity of some transactions, including the undisclosed purchase of racehorses, which cost shareholders millions of dollars. Lord Hanson was knighted in 1976 under Harold Wilson, the Labor prime minister, and given a life peerage as Lord Hanson of Edgerton in 1983, during the Thatcher years. He was a major contributor to Conservative Party funds, and The Daily Mirror tabloid recalled on Tuesday that he had been ''known as Lord Moneybags,'' a label first coined by The Sun, another tabloid.", "title": "Lord Hanson, 82; Built Industrial Empire"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/Business", "Top/News/Obituaries", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe/Britain"], "publication_day_of_month": "3", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Business; Obituaries", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Business/Financial Desk", "print_page_number": "15", "publication_day_of_week": "Wednesday", "print_section": "C", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/03/business/worldbusiness/03hanson.html", "print_column": "4", "slug": "03HANS$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan, a Bedouin tribesman who became president of the federation known as the United Arab Emirates and one of the Arab world's leading statesmen, died yesterday. He was believed to be 86. He had been suffering from diabetes and kidney problems. His death was reported by the official news agency of the emirates, WAM. Sheik Zayed, also ruler of Abu Dhabi, largest of the emirates, became a symbol of his region's breathtakingly brisk march from tribal fiefs, where personal worth was measured in camels, to oil-drenched welfare states with sleek skyscrapers, global banks and indoor ski slopes. As a ruler for almost 40 years, he flew in his personal jet to his far-flung palaces and houses, including the former home of Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in London, an estate in the English countryside once owned by Ringo Starr and a villa on the Costa del Sol with separate entrances for men and women. Sheik Zayed's profound achievements more than matched his flamboyance. He steered Abu Dhabi, his family's sheikdom, to independence from the British, and engineered its consolidation into the United Arab Emirates, a union of seven city states on the western side of the Persian Gulf. His political legerdemain, amply greased with petrodollars, kept this often fractious union of tribal states together in what became what many consider the first successful modern federation of Arab states. His foreign policy was equally adept: he managed to support the United States in both its wars against Iraq quietly enough to soothe prickly regional sensibilities. ''It is almost impossible to overstate his importance,'' said Gary Sick, who is a professor of international relations at Columbia University and served on the National Security Council for Presidents Ford, Carter and Reagan. ''He really is the father of the country.'' His people enjoyed cradle-to-grave government services, including free schools, free health care and some of the world's highest personal incomes. He built cities, towns, hospitals and universities. Under Sheik Zayed, the Emirates took enormous steps toward sexual equality. Ninety-nine percent of its girls are in school, and illiteracy among girls and women ages 10 or older dropped to 11.3 percent. Women serve in the armed forces and as police officers. Sheik Zayed, for all his delight in projects like bringing forests of palm trees to the Chelsea Flower Show, remained a Bedouin at heart. The language he spoke was not the sophisticated Arabic of Cairo and Beirut but the heavier, guttural dialect of the desert. He reveled in the regular meeting, called the majlis, at which Arab royalty welcome one and all. Barefoot and leaning on a camel saddle, he personally spooned out sweets to his guests. With the royal falcons under hoods on the gauntleted wrists of the royal falconers, the sheik sometimes granted large requests. His generosity to various charities was extensive, to causes from displaced Afghans and Palestinians to Iraqi war victims -- and often to the lowliest goat-herder. ''He is one of the few leaders of the Arab world who actually displayed generosity in a clever and wise fashion,'' said Joseph A. Kechichian, who is writing a book on succession in Persian Gulf royal families. Still, philanthropy could be complicated. In 2004, he withdrew a $2.5 million gift to Harvard Divinity School after protests about his earlier support of an Abu Dhabi research center that had invited anti-Semitic speakers. Sheik Zayed had already closed the center, saying it ''starkly contradicted the principles of interfaith tolerance.'' In an article in October 2004 that reported on a $25 million gift by the sheik to Minnesota's Mayo Clinic, The Minneapolis Star Tribune quoted Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Wiesenthal Center defending the sheik's actions. ''He is the only Arab head of state who has explicitly dealt with and condemned this sort of anti-Semitism and anti-Americanism,'' the rabbi said. Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan was born in Abu Dhabi town, the capital of the Abu Dhabi kingdom which fronts the Persian Gulf for about 280 miles. The year is uncertain, but 1918 is often cited. He was the youngest of four sons of Sheik Sultan bin Zayed al-Nahayan, ruler of Abu Dhabi from 1922 to 1926. He was named after his grandfather, who ruled the country from 1855 to 1909 and was known as Sheik Zayed the Great. Few records of his youth survive, but it is known that the emirate's leading family boasted 180 horses and 400 camels, according to The Financial Times in 1999. After the death of his father in 1927, he moved to Al Ain, an oasis town. Most of his education was instruction in Islam from the local preacher. In the 1930's, Sheik Zayed worked as a guide for foreign crews exploring for petroleum. In 1946, he was appointed the ruler's representative, or governor, of the area encompassing his oasis. Oil was discovered in 1958, and in August 1966, Sheik Zayed pushed aside his brother Sheik Shakbut as ruler of Abu Dhabi. The chief complaint against Sheik Shakbut was that he refused to spend the petroleum royalties. The British, who had long been the pre-eminent foreign power in the area, helped Sheik Zayed in his bloodless coup. Since 1853, when it signed a treaty with Abu Dhabi and nearby sheikdoms to quell piracy, Britain had run their foreign affairs and often their internal affairs. But in 1968, London announced that it was withdrawing from every place east of Suez in 1971. That meant the Trucial States, which included Abu Dhabi, so named because they were established by a treaty, would be on their own. That year, Sheik Zayed and Sheik Rashid bin Saeed al-Maktoum, ruler of neighboring Dubai, laid the basis of a confederated state by forming an alliance between themselves. With British help, Sheiks Zayed and Rashid gathered the other soon-to-be-independent states together in a federation. Bahrain and Qatar, two neighboring Arab countries that London had wanted to join, chose to go their own way. Six emirates that came together in 1971 to form the United Arab Emirates were Abu Dhabi (by far the largest in wealth, population and size), Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al Qaiwain and Fujariah. Ras al Khaimah did not join until 1972. The other emirate leaders elected Sheik Zayed the country's first president and re-elected him at five-year intervals ever since. Although the sheik was often credited with shrewdness, he found himself engulfed in an international banking scandal in the 1991 collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, an Abu Dhabi bank of which he was the largest stockholder. Bank officials he trusted were found to be guilty of offenses that included money laundering, arms trafficking and the sale of nuclear technologies. By some estimates, the bank's collapse cost the Emirates $10 billion. Sheik Zayed was not linked to the wrongdoing. The sheik's legacy is evident in the gleaming steel and glass of the capital as well as in his conservation work. He planted millions of palms and fruit trees and undertook breeding programs for 80 species of animals. He received a Golden Panda Award from the Worldwide Fund for Nature in 1997. Sheik Zayed is survived by four wives, 19 sons and an estimated 21 daughters, Mr. Kechichian said. He will be succeeded as ruler of Abu Dhabi by the crown prince, his son Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan. Mr. Kechichian said those survivors stand to inherit his personal fortune of $25 billion to $50 billion.", "title": "Zayed bin Sultan Is Dead; Gulf Leader and Statesman"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/World", "Top/News/Obituaries", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Middle East", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Middle East/United Arab Emirates"], "publication_day_of_month": "3", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "World; Obituaries", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Foreign Desk", "print_page_number": "15", "publication_day_of_week": "Wednesday", "print_section": "C", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/03/international/middleeast/03zayed.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "03ZAYE$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Visitors to Victoria Gardens, which its creator calls ''a superregional lifestyle center,'' may have a sense of the uncanny. Within an area that encompasses 1.3 million square feet of retail and office space covering 12 blocks of this affluent suburb 50 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, they may feel as though they are in a city that has existed for decades. And yet it has actually been open only for less than a week. A turn-of-the-century citrus-packing plant inspired the building that houses the food court. Next door is a replica Craftsman home, of the type built in this region in the early 1900's. Elsewhere are a group of 1940's-style department stores, as well as an Art Deco building, whose side walls of plain red brick add a note of humility to the elegant facade. (The bricks are actually painted on a stucco surface, in a trompe l'oeil style.) A freestanding brick fireplace, accented with colored tiles, purports to represent the remnant of a rancher's house long destroyed by fire. The conceit of a built-in history for the $285 million Victoria Gardens is likely to rankle those who insist on historic authenticity in architecture, even though others may be intrigued by the skill of architects in fabricating a downtown that might have been, but never was. Despite the vein of historical fantasy running through Victoria Gardens, the developers were intent on creating ''a real urban place,'' said Brian Jones, president of Forest City Development California Inc., a Los Angeles-based unit of Forest City Enterprises of Cleveland, which developed the project in a venture with Lewis Retail Centers. ''The last thing we wanted to do was a theme park,'' Mr. Jones added. Covering 147 acres, Victoria Gardens is one of the latest, and perhaps most sophisticated, of the ''town center'' projects that try to import the experience of pedestrian-oriented shopping to suburban places. The premise of these outdoor shopping streets is to provide a gathering place as well as retailing, as opposed to car-oriented forms of retailing -- notably enclosed regional malls or discount centers -- that offer plentiful goods but few places to sit. ''Retail has become polarized, in the form of value versus experience,'' said Simon Horton, Forest City's project developer. Although Rancho Cucamonga has been a city for little more than 27 years, the community has a history dating back to the early 19th century, when the area was a Spanish land grant in the shadow of the San Bernardino Mountains a few miles north. With a rich alluvial soil, the rancho rapidly became a farming center of lemon groves and vineyards. Following an archetypal pattern for suburban growth in Southern California, home builders bought up much of the farmland in the 1970's, building more than 7,000 single-family homes. With mountain views and freeway access to jobs in both Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties, Rancho Cucamonga has quadrupled in population since the 1970's, to the present total of 165,000 people. Forest City, the developer, first entered the city five years ago, responding to a request for proposals from the city for a mall developer. Mr. Jones said he urged city officials to scrap the planned mall and build a project with a more urban character. ''It was a shock initially,'' said Linda Daniels, the city's redevelopment director. Mr. Jones added, ''It took several months to educate the city, and since then they have been behind us all the way.'' The presence of a successful regional mall only three miles away, in the city of Ontario, was one factor that made city officials receptive to the town center proposal, according to Ms. Daniels. The notion of a mixed-use development also appealed to officials, who had designated a retail project as the center of a 400-acre redevelopment area. ''We have incorporated entertainment, we have offices and residential, so the project is actually a community gathering place,'' said Mr. Jones, who plans to build 400 town house units north of the retail site in a second phase. Many of the merchants initially approached by the developers expressed apprehension that they would not have such traditional amenities as street-front visibility from Foothill Boulevard, the city's main commercial street, or prominent roadside signs, according to Ms. Daniels, the city official. Among the factors that helped to sway the merchants were the city's high household income and the promise from the city to build a public library and a performing arts center, which are expected to be used by 500,000 people annually. Currently, the 1.3-million-square-foot mall is 80 percent leased, primarily with national chains. The developers already plan a second phase of 500,000 square feet, to start construction next year. The site plan is intended to avoid the uniformity of scale of many projects, according to Yann Taylor, a principal of Field Paoli, the San Francisco firm that designed the master plan. ''We wanted to avoid a formulaic approach in which all the streets have the same width,'' he said. Instead, ''each street has a slightly different character and is planted with a different type of tree, to contribute to the sense of the project having been built up over time.'' Mr. Jones, the developer, said, ''The green spaces and open spaces are as important as the buildings.'' He said the spending on landscaping at Victoria Gardens was six times what he had spent on other regional malls. Much of that expense went to transplanting mature trees at the site. To avoid a design that was obviously the product of a single designer, the developers hired several firms -- including Altoon & Porter of Los Angeles, KA Inc. of Cleveland, Elkus/Manfredi of Boston and Field Paoli -- each to contribute several buildings. According to the architect Ronald Altoon, a principal of Altoon & Porter, the historical theme of Victoria Gardens gave free rein to him and his staff to explore the notion of buildings that clashed with one another. In one case, a reddish-orange building in a 1940's style makes a screaming contrast with some 1970's-style buildings nearby. ''The great cities,'' Mr. Altoon said, ''are the ones that have dissonant voices, where buildings sit a little bit uncomfortably next to each other and ask the question, How can that be?'' Despite its urban bravura, Victoria Gardens is an amalgam of the regional mall with elements of traditional town planning. As in a mall, the developer has arranged the merchants in a ''dumbbell'' formation, with major department stores to the east and west and smaller merchants filling the space between. Unlike a mall, however, Victoria Gardens follows a city pattern, dividing into a dozen blocks with a regular street grid. Perhaps the most innovative part of the site planning is that the private development has been designed to blend into the existing street pattern of the city by aligning with existing streets. ''This project is not a stand-alone; it is not isolated,'' Ms. Daniels, the city's redevelopment director, said. Victoria Gardens, rather, is ''meant to integrate with the residential neighborhoods that surround it.'' Like Geppetto, the fictional puppet maker who wished the wooden Pinocchio could become a real boy, both city officials and developers say they are hoping Victoria Gardens will become an actual city center, not just a themed shopping center. Putting the project within the city's street grid ''will allow it to grow in an organic way, unlike a mall,'' Mr. Jones said. For Ms. Daniels, ''civic and cultural uses are the things that are going to make it a downtown.'' Accordingly, the city has started construction on both the new library and the performing arts center as a part of the project's second phase.

Increasingly, this includes financial businesses that might previously have set up shop downtown in the financial district. Among recent arrivals, an executive of a company that combines high technology with high finance said he chose the neighborhood because locating there conveys the idea of ''an aggressive, fast-moving'' operation. The head of another company, SuperDerivatives, which establishes the values of currency options contracts, said the location suggested his company was ''very successful.'' ''Financial firms like to be near other financial firms,'' said David Gershon, chief executive of SuperDerivatives, from his corner office on the 35th floor of Times Square Tower, a new skyscraper on a block running from Broadway to Seventh Avenue and from 41st to 42nd Streets. ''Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers, both clients, are just up the street; Reuters and Ernst & Young are right here; and there have to be 20 banks within walking distance.'' The 1.2-million-square-foot building was developed by Boston Properties and opened in April. Officials of the company say it is 79 percent full, despite the demise of Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm that was to be the anchor tenant. The building, also known as 7 Times Square, is the last of four skyscrapers that are part of the renewal of 42nd Street's intersection with Seventh Avenue and Broadway. Another accounting firm, Ernst & Young, occupies the entire building directly across Seventh Avenue, 5 Times Square, which was also developed by Boston Properties. The northwest corner is 3 Times Square; it was jointly developed by the Rudin family and Reuters, the news and financial data company. Between 42nd and 43rd Streets on Broadway, 4 Times Square was developed by the Durst Organization and is known as the Cond\u00e9 Nast Building for the publishing company that is its principal tenant. Most of the rest of the Cond\u00e9 Nast block, running east to the Avenue of the Americas, is to be occupied by 1 Bryant Park, which will be the biggest of the new towers in the area, a 2.1-million-square-foot building being developed by Durst and Bank of America, the principal tenant. The new buildings are attractive to financial services companies, which want ultramodern space and do not shrink at rentals around $55 to $65 a square foot annually, said Jeffrey I. Peck, a managing director of Newmark & Company Real Estate. These rents are roughly double those in the Wall Street area, even before city and state incentives are taken into consideration. Some tenants that have moved to Midtown say the difference could be a powerful lure for companies seeking bargains. ''People can get great prices downtown, and that may change things over time,'' Mr. Gershon said. ''Right now, the cycle is trending more toward Midtown, and that may take a few years to reverse.'' Mr. Peck, who recently brokered the SuperDerivatives lease and a 5,000-square-foot deal for a finance-related company in Times Square Tower, said some smaller companies were attracted to the prebuilt office suites available in some buildings. Taking space that is already finished means they can set up operations in weeks, rather than the months needed for finishing off raw space. He said they were also attracted by the high-speed elevators and wireless Internet connections, or Wi-Fi, available in some new buildings. The elevator system at Times Square Tower, for example, aims to minimize waiting time. After passing through security in the lobby, all visitors go by elevator to a sky lobby on the fifth floor. There, they face three banks of elevators, for the low-, mid- and high-rise sections of the 47- story building. At the entrance to each bank, there is a keypad, where a visitor can punch in the desired floor. A light and a sound indicate which car will be first to go to that floor. Building managers say the system moves people to their destinations 25 percent faster than conventional elevators. Kevin Gould, an executive vice president of Mark-It Partners, mentions the elevator speed as one of the building's advantages. He said the company recently made two acquisitions and the new site allowed it to consolidate all its United States operations in one place. The company is moving into prebuilt space, but the appearance on a recent visit was one of controlled confusion, with workers adding finishing touches and meetings being held in a circle of chairs because the conference table had not yet arrived. Mr. Gould said Mark-It had grown to more than 300 clients in three and a half years and was still growing. It serves financial companies by collecting their trading data on bonds and other instruments and accounting for their value, or ''marking it to market'' -- hence the name. ''We looked at two spaces,'' he continued, ''and took this on quickly because it is close to the banks and things like the hedge funds on Park Avenue.'' Mr. Gould said the convergence of subway lines at Times Square was another reason for choosing the location. ''If we have to go to Wall Street,'' he said, ''we can get there pretty quickly.'' He said that from personal experience, he felt certain the area was growing into a financial center. ''A month ago we signed a big contract with a hedge fund,'' he added, ''and now they are opening offices down the hall.'' Mr. Gould is aware of Times Square's onetime image, but considers that ancient history. ''It was not even a consideration in our decision,'' he said.

His Arnell Group has landed an important project from a company that regularly works with an Omnicom competitor. The Arnell Group, based in New York, planned to announce today that it is being awarded a global assignment from Electrolux, the world's biggest maker of home and outdoor appliances, which uses as its global agency of record Lowe & Partners Worldwide, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Mr. Arnell, the chairman and chief executive of the Arnell Group, is to oversee a broad effort -- everything from product design to in-store marketing to traditional advertising -- to help Electrolux introduce a line of small domestic appliances, tentatively scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2005. Mr. Arnell, who sold the Arnell Group to Omnicom in June 2001, is known for wooing chief executives and other senior managers of large advertisers, who assign his agency projects and consulting chores; current clients include DaimlerChrysler, Diageo, Mars, Reebok International and Unilever. Often his strategic advice leads the advertisers to hire the Arnell Group or other Omnicom agencies. Hence, the recent description of Mr. Arnell by the trade publication Advertising Age as the secret weapon of John D. Wren, the Omnicom president and chief executive. Needless to say, Mr. Arnell is not infallible. His most-publicized flop involved an extensive, and expensive, campaign for Chrysler that was centered on the singer Celine Dion. The campaign, originally scheduled to run three years, lasted not much more than one, and its failure contributed to the resignation last year of its most ardent fan, James C. Schroer, executive vice president for global sales, marketing and service at the Chrysler Group division of DaimlerChrysler. But it is a different matter when Mr. Arnell can do the voodoo that he does so well. For instance, last month Unilever shifted the account of its Lipton tea products in the United States to an Omnicom agency, DDB Worldwide in New York, from an agency owned by the WPP Group, J. Walter Thompson in New York. Mr. Arnell has been providing Unilever with ideas on reintroducing the Lipton brand to American consumers in 2005, Advertising Age reported. Lars Goran Johansson, senior vice president for corporate communications at Electrolux in Stockholm, said Electrolux was attracted to Mr. Arnell by his reputation for thinking beyond the boundaries of conventional advertising and venturing into realms like graphic design, retail marketing and branded entertainment. For example, for a previous client, Samsung, Mr. Arnell recognized the appeal to young adult consumers of photographs of a shirtless man holding a Samsung microwave oven, which were originally shot for print ads. The images were subsequently used on oversized outdoor signs in big cities and the cardboard boxes in which the ovens were packaged. Some buyers even displayed the empty boxes on their kitchen shelves, above the ovens. ''This is a different kind of business, an interesting mixture of design, creativity and technology,'' Mr. Johansson said. The experience consumers have with brands, in stores and at home, is becoming just as important in shaping their perceptions of those brands as traditional ads, if not more so, Mr. Johansson said. So Mr. Arnell's reputation for ''doing something different, something cool,'' he added, played a large part in awarding the Arnell Group the assignment, for which spending has not been determined. Mr. Arnell said he welcomed the assignment because ''the brand positioning and strategy will be embedded in the product development and design.'' ''In this iPod economy, clearly design has become one of the most important differentiating tools for brands,'' Mr. Arnell said. ''It's a powerful place to be these days.'' Mr. Arnell said he was also designing a store being opened in Midtown Manhattan by Jacob the Jeweler, the purveyor to the stars of diamond-encrusted watches and other jewelry, so that it evokes the interior of a gem mine, as well as a store in Philadelphia that will serve as a showcase for the Rbk line of clothing and footwear sold by Reebok. Also on the Arnell Group's list of tasks, Mr. Arnell said, is the introduction of a line of fire extinguishers and other home-safety products for a company called Home Hero, owned by Thomas Von Essen, the former New York City fire commissioner. The typical fire extinguisher could stand to be redesigned because ''it's so ugly, nobody wants to leave it on a counter,'' Mr. Arnell said. ''We need a product like what Braun did with coffee makers.'' Mr. Arnell described the products he will help design and develop for Electrolux as ''small-task domestic appliances,'' like coffee makers, toasters and blenders. Mr. Johansson described them as ''an entry point for consumers to our bigger products,'' like ovens, refrigerators, dishwashers and vacuums. The new Electrolux line, still unnamed, will be branded differently from Electrolux floor-care products and other brands the company sells under names like Eureka and Frigidaire. This week Electrolux is introducing a campaign by Lowe in the United States to promote a new, higher-priced line of major appliances, called Electrolux Icon, which were first sold in Europe. The campaign, with a budget estimated at $70 million over the next three years, is separate from ads for the regularly priced line of Electrolux appliances. Electrolux hired the London, New York and Stockholm offices of Lowe in January 2003 to develop brand campaigns. Asked what effect the hiring of the Arnell Group and Mr. Arnell would have on Lowe, Mr. Johansson replied, ''I don't see this as competition,'' adding that Lowe remained the company's global agency of record. The new line is ''a way to show Electrolux is interesting,'' Mr. Johansson said, by having the products be ''different in function and design'' from what is now sold in the small-appliance market. ''We want consumers to say, 'Wow, I didn't know I needed that,''' he added.

He was arrested by early morning light on Governors Island after apparently swimming there through the waters of New York Harbor, the authorities said. He planted a flag of his own devising, explorer-style, on the island, which is already claimed by the State of New York. The man, David W. Nash, 41, of Ashland, Va., was wearing a scuba suit, the police said. A bag with wet clothes was nearby. The flag bore the words ''The Blue Tulip Party,'' on whose unique platform he had run for president in 2000. As police officers from the First Precinct and the New York Harbor Patrol arrested Mr. Nash, he yelled, ''I've been trying to get members since 1999,'' the authorities said. Mr. Nash was in police custody yesterday and was being examined at Bellevue Hospital Center, after being labeled, in police parlance, an ''emotionally disturbed person.'' No one observed Mr. Nash emerging from the cold waters off Governors Island, a former Civil War prison for Confederate officers, but other methods of reaching the island are very limited. The National Park Service operates a ferry, but it is not open to the public at this time of year, and identification is required of those who board. ''We have very tight security,'' said Brian Feeney, a spokesman for the park service. A woman who answered the telephone at Mr. Nash's Virginia home and identified herself as his mother said he ''has been swimming since he was a child.'' She said that her son had told her he was visiting New York City, but that she had not talked to him in about a week. Edwin Levine, a liaison to the United States Coast Guard from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said that swimming conditions were ideal in the harbor yesterday. Mr. Nash was noticed, reported and arrested between 7 and 8 a.m. There was little current in the harbor at that time. Indeed, Mr. Levine said, at 6:57 a.m., there is slack tide, or no current at all. The shortest distance to Governors Island, from Pier 9B in Brooklyn, is just over a quarter of a mile; the distance from Battery Park in Manhattan is just over half a mile. Mr. Levine pointed out that many good swimmers had circumnavigated Manhattan. The water temperature in the harbor was 57 degrees Fahrenheit, but Mr. Nash was wearing a wet suit at the time of his arrest. ''He probably knew what he was doing,'' Mr. Levine said.

Lives are at risk. Every year, we are told, influenza kills multitudes of vulnerable people, and the death toll is often repeated: 36,000 die annually in the United States alone. The lethal efficiency of the flu has come as a surprise to many, it turns out, because almost no one is ever officially classified as dying of influenza. There is no public national accounting of who had influenza listed on their death certificate. But of the roughly 2,500 deaths estimated by city health officials to have been caused by the virus in New York City in 2002, influenza was listed as the cause of death for only two people. The previous year, not a single death certificate listed it, according to city health records. It turns out that while federal and state health officials all proclaim great confidence in the annual estimates of those killed by the flu, the system for deriving the numbers is complex, imprecise and anonymous. Part of the problem is that the flu is not often a direct killer but rather the fatal ingredient in a mix of factors that lead to someone's death. ''It sets the stage for the susceptible host to crumble,'' said Dr. Jonathan M. Raskin, a pulmonologist in Manhattan. The system by which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene come up with an average annual death toll for flu are the same and are relatively simple. Dr. Farzad Mostashari, an epidemiologist with the City Health Department, said that both the department and the C.D.C. look at the average number of pneumonia deaths during a given period and set them against what is known about flu activity during that period. When the flu is present, they check for marked increases in the number of pneumonia cases. All the cases above the average are attributed to the flu, he said. New York City fits in with all the national patterns. For instance, the majority of flu fatalities occur among the elderly. In 2002, pneumonia/influenza did not make the list of the top 10 killers for people 35 to 54. However, for those 65 to 74 it ranked sixth, killing 290 people. For those 75 to 84, it ranked third, killing 747. Dr. Mostashari also noted that studies have led researchers to believe that flu deaths have been coded as heart disease in many cases. While he expressed confidence in the statistical analysis that leads health officials to come up with average annual deaths, he did say it was a best guess, given the variety of factors that can complicate the severity of the flu. Doctors and health officials also noted that each year there have been wide fluctuations in the estimates of those killed by flu because different strains are more deadly. The virus changes every year, and the more it does, the more likely it will find victims who cannot resist it. These figures, again, are determined by the number of pneumonia deaths during flu season. The strain the public will face this year is still unknown, though the few cases that have been reported indicate that it is a familiar one. There are surveillance centers across the city and the nation to provide officials with an analysis of flu strains as they begin to surface in communities; it is this data that is used to track flu activity. A disaster like the Spanish flu pandemic, which struck in 1918 and killed some 600,000 people in the United States, was a very different situation. Even if there had been vaccines then, they would have had little effect because the flu strain was unknown. It is interesting to note that the victims of that virus were for the most part young and healthy, as opposed to the normal situation in which infants, the elderly and the chronically ill are most at risk. This year, the notion of those most at risk has been drilled home as never before -- children under 2, adults 65 and older and people with chronic health problems like asthma. Dr. Stephen S. Morse, the director of the Center for Public Health Preparedness at the Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University, explained why those groups are vulnerable. ''One of two things can happen,'' he said. ''The flu can get in the lungs.'' In that case, it often leads to pneumonia. The second way the flu can prove fatal, Dr. Morse said, is that it can lead to secondary infections. However, neither the city nor the federal government breaks down who dies from flu beyond tracking pneumonia cases. Given this season's vaccine shortage, that could make deciding who gets shots even more difficult if it turns out that there are not enough for the people in the high-risk categories. The Centers for Disease Control has convened a panel of ethicists to look into just that question. Without data to suggest that someone with emphysema, for example, is more vulnerable than someone infected with H.I.V. or AIDS, any further rationing will have to be left up to private physicians. As it stands, the vaccine shortage will likely leave doctors in the position of prescribing more anti-viral medication than in years past. Dr. Raskin, the pulmonologist, said that he typically prescribe anti-viral drugs regardless of whether patients have had a flu shot. He noted that the public does not seem to realize that there are several anti-viral drugs that can be very effective in saving lives, provided a patient is diagnosed and treated quickly. The doctor, who said he treats a large number of at-risk patients, added that he relied mainly on observation to determine if a person is suffering from the flu. ''Someone comes to me with a viral illness, there is a battery of tests we can run,'' he said. But that would cost upward of $5,000 and take weeks, he said, so he relies mainly on the symptoms they show. A cold and a flu may often be confused in common conversation, but Dr. Raskin said there are some telltale signs of flu. Namely, those afflicted with it usually have a very high fever, 102.8 degrees or more, and are so sore they can barely move. ''You just can't get off the bed,'' he said. So far, he said, there has been no great demand for anti-viral medications.", "title": "The Flu Kills, But Documents Rarely List It As the Killer"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/New York", "Top/News/U.S./Mid-Atlantic", "Top/News/New York and Region", "Top/News/Health", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Healthcare", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Medicine and Health", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Pneumonia", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Viruses", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Influenza", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Vaccination and Immunization", "Top/News/Health/Diseases, Conditions, and Health Topics/Emphysema", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/New York/New York City"], "publication_day_of_month": "3", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Health; New York and Region", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Metropolitan Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Wednesday", "print_section": "B", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/03/nyregion/03flu.html", "print_column": "5", "slug": "03FLU.$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "The waiters, bartenders, room cleaners and cooks who struck seven Atlantic City casinos for a month will all but certainly approve a settlement tonight that will give them much of what they wanted, but not quite everything, strikers said yesterday. ''There's no way it's not going to be ratified, because we got more than we even asked for,'' said Joy Korngut, a bartender at the Atlantic City Hilton casino. The union, Local 54 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International, did not get the three-year contract it sought, but in agreeing to the five-year deal the casinos wanted, the union bargaining committee won limits on the future subcontracting of casino and resort attractions to nonunion businesses as well as improvements in wages and health care benefits. ''I think we are all very excited to get back to work, because it's been a long month,'' said Heidi Moffitt, a beverage server at the Hilton. ''It seems like they gave us a lot of the things we were fighting for.'' The union's nearly 10,000 Atlantic City workers struck 7 of the city's 12 casinos on Oct. 1 in an effort to make sure that new, nongambling attractions opened by the casinos would be unionized. The attractions, like restaurants, spas and shops, have ordinarily been subcontracted to national chains. Under the proposed settlement, Tropicana Casino and Resort and Resorts Atlantic City will be allowed to add one each of the nonunion subcontractors during the life of the contract, while existing arrangements with outside companies at all of the casinos remain unaffected. The strike was against Bally's Atlantic City, Caesars Atlantic City, Resorts Atlantic City, Harrah's Atlantic City, the Atlantic City Hilton Casino Resort, the Showboat and Tropicana Casino and Resort. The city's three Trump properties avoided the strike by settling early. Workers at the Sands remained on the job after that casino agreed to sign the same contract the others would eventually sign, and the Borgata signed a separate contract when it opened last year. Jackie Dimmerman, a waitress at the Seaside Cafe at the Tropicana and a member of the union bargaining committee, attended the session, which began at 11 a.m. Monday and did not end until just before midnight. ''The hardest part was at the very end, when we said to them that we would not take down our picket signs until we knew that the contract was absolutely solid tomorrow,'' she said. ''We thought they would say no, but they said yes, and now everything is absolutely perfect. Thank God, it's done, it's done, it's done.'' On wages and benefits, the union won a 28.3 percent increase over five years, a figure that was said by members to include the costs of improved company contributions to health insurance. Also, unions will continue to represent workers should properties change ownership during the life of the contract. The biggest stumbling block in the bargaining appeared to be the union's insistence on a three-year agreement, which would have had its contracts for casinos in Las Vegas, Chicago and several riverboats expire in the same year. The casinos, loath to give the union the power to call a nationwide strike, prevailed. After several weeks on the picket line, said Debbie Paolella, a waitress at the Showboat, the issue seemed less important than at first. ''At the beginning we were all very strong on the three-year deal,'' Ms. Paolella said. ''But once we were out there, we were thinking, if they give us everything else we wanted, the five years would be O.K.'' Ms. Paolella's husband was a dealer at the Trump Plaza, one of the three Trump properties that settled early, and so he continued to work. Still, she said, it was a rough month.

Charges that the two ex-presidents and several other high-ranking officials took bribes in return for steering government contracts might not merit a shrug in many Latin American countries. But here, in the self-styled Switzerland of Central America, a place founded by farmers with egalitarian ideals, a Jeffersonian democracy, an oasis of peace in a region plagued by coups, wars, corruption and dictatorships, it has provoked a crisis of national identity. Some are even asking whether their identity was always a sham, a fairy tale for schoolchildren. ''We might have lost our innocence in this case,'' said Antonio Barras, a political scientist at the National University of Costa Rica. ''What most people are saying is that they no longer believe the politicians.'' But that does not necessarily mean Costa Ricans have lost faith in their system of government. Indeed, many here see the recent disclosures as proof they have a functioning democracy, with a system of checks and balances, a fiercely independent judiciary and a free press. Until the recent disclosures, the country was probably best known to the outside world for its rain forests, the abolition of its military and former President \u00d3scar Arias, who won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his efforts to stop the Central American wars. And for its national mythology, which is based partly on historical fact. Despite its name (Costa Rica means rich coast), the country never had any mineral wealth, nor did it have a large Indian population that could be enslaved. So the Spaniards who settled here turned to agriculture, creating a population largely of independent yeoman farmers, the sort Thomas Jefferson idolized. Costa Rica's poverty and isolation from Spanish colonial centers led to a strong tradition of individualism and egalitarian thinking. The country held its first free elections in 1899, and democracy has flourished here with only two interruptions -- the short-lived dictatorship of Federico Tinoco in 1917 and a 44-day civil war in 1948, when Jos\u00e9 Figueres Ferrer led an armed uprising after a rigged election. The revolt finally curbed the power of a coffee-producer oligarchy that had been struggling for political power with Communists and other left-leaning liberals since the days of Mr. Tinoco's rule. After the war, the country produced the current Constitution, guaranteeing free elections, universal suffrage and the abolition of the military. Since then, Costa Rica has an impressive score: 13 presidential elections, no coups, no civil wars. But democracy did not keep the country from going the way of most of Latin America in the 1970's and 80's, when it formed state monopolies over things like power, water, telephones and insurance. It was the lucrative state contracts to administer those public entities that, in the 1990's, gave senior officials the ability to extract kickbacks and bribes from foreign companies, prosecutors say. Indeed, the country saw several small but embarrassing scandals during the 1990's, like the embezzlement of public funds meant for social programs, and polls showed that politicians were generally out of favor with voters, even before the recent allegations. Turnout was low in the 2002 election. ''The perception was that politicians were corrupt,'' said Luis Sol\u00eds, a political scientist at the University of Costa Rica. ''The big fish were just never caught.'' Then came the sordid disclosures of the past month. First, former President Miguel \u00c1ngel Rodr\u00edguez, a conservative economist elected in 1998 on a pledge to privatize government-owned sectors, was arrested on Oct. 15 on charges that he took a part of $2.4 million in kickbacks from the French telephone company Alcatel. The arrest was particularly embarrassing because Mr. Rodr\u00edguez was forced to resign as secretary general of the Organization of American States. Then, within a week, another ex-president, Rafael \u00c1ngel Calder\u00f3n Jr., who served from 1990 to 1994, was arrested and charged with taking a $500,000 payment to steer a government contract for medical equipment to a Finnish company. The payment was part of $9.2 million in kickbacks distributed to various officials in the social security system. The local media broke both stories, and the frenzy continued with front-page disclosures that a third former president, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres, who was the son of the revolutionary hero and served from 1994 to 1998, had earned $900,000 as a consultant to Alcatel in 1999, long after he was out of office. Though not strictly criminal, the payments have caused more grumbling about conflicts of interest. Politicians from all camps are worried about the fallout from the scandals. Newspaper columnists are speculating that Francisco Dall'Aneses, the country's chief prosecutor and virtually the only popular public servant, will run for president after he has finished putting the former presidents behind bars. Some legislators talk of a brewing ''moral revolution'' that they believe will sweep them from office. In the end, most here agree, from intellectuals to people in the street, that the current crisis is a test of the nation's democratic institutions, and therefore a test of the nation's claim to being unique in Central America. The proof will come in the courts. If Costa Rican prosecutors and judges can fairly try two ex-presidents and dozens of other officials on corruption charges and send the guilty to jail, there will be little doubt the country has crossed a new threshold in its history, one other countries in the region have yet to approach. President Pacheco, who has not been implicated in the scandals, insists that the arrests prove Costa Rica is and always has been a ''solid, functioning democracy'' where no one is above the law. On the streets, people are waiting to see if that is true.

If circumstances were different she might make a fine wife. She is young, brown-eyed and curvy, a pediatric dentist who quotes 19th-century poetry and cooks delicious meals. She lives near the Caspian Sea in southern Russia but is eager to travel. Her Russian is fluent; her English, not bad. Ms. Medvedeva is also cautious, even demure. It is only after she grows comfortable with a suitor that she will reveal the depth of her longing. Then nothing can hold her back. ''Hi, my Lion!'' she wrote to Steven Rammer of Denver, Pa., as they planned a passionate rendezvous at his home. ''Hi, my soul!'' That rendezvous never happened. Nor did another she arranged for two days later with George Palin, who waited in vain in Montana. No matter how long the trail of the jilted, Nadezhda (''call me Nadia'') Medvedeva is neither a tease prone to second thoughts nor an overbooked online tramp. She is not even a person. She is bait. Ms. Medvedeva is one of scores, perhaps hundreds, of fictional characters in a resurgent Internet hustle that has become a Russian boom industry this year. Using fake names, forged visas and snapshots of young Russian women, a new crop of on-line swindlers is luring Western victims into highly successful confidence games. Each is an escalating flirtation between an unsuspecting man and a Russian grifter masquerading as a young woman. It typically ends when the victim wires money to Russia to pay for visas and airfare for a consummation of the affair. Then the beloved disappears. The con first surfaced in 2001 but then subsided, Russian authorities say. It has recently returned with vigor and new sophistication. The targets are men in the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand who have posted personal advertisements on the Internet. The crime has become so widespread that the United States Embassy here is receiving between 5 and 10 inquiries from American citizens about it every day, an American diplomat said. ''Some of these guys were literally left waiting at the airport with roses,'' she said. Most victims lose from $300 to a few thousand dollars, although one man was defrauded of $11,000, the diplomat said. The number of men duped is at least in the hundreds, but it may be much larger. ''We only know about the victims who are willing to talk about it,'' she said. Modern Russia is in many ways an incubator for such crimes. It has a highly literate population that suffers from low wages and soaring unemployment, conditions that can breed hustlers. It offers them an environment in which they can work, including uneven law enforcement and barriers to outsiders -- a language many find impenetrable, strict visa rules and vast geographical spaces -- that all but ensure that few fooled Americans could ever find the people who tricked them. Mr. Rammer and Mr. Palin both gave The New York Times the correspondence they had received from the person pretending to be Ms. Medvedeva. The string of e-mail messages provides an example of how the game works. In June the correspondent sent an e-mail message to Mr. Rammer, replying to a personal advertisement he had posted on match.com, an online dating service. It seemed a normal query, offering basic personal information -- I'm 29, 5 feet 6 inches tall, a dentist -- and then following the rituals of new acquaintance. Do you like your job? What is your favorite film? A long-distance conversation began. More e-mail followed, each message with an attached photograph. The character of Ms. Medvedeva was slowly revealed. She is educated but of limited means. She knows popular Western films and classical Russian music. She provides dental care to orphans. She had a boyfriend, but he beat her. Now she is alone. As the exchange intensified the grifter accepted pictures from Mr. Rammer, sent back compliments and answered questions he had posed. Two e-mail messages included pictures of Ms. Medvedeva in a bikini. On July 13 Ms. Medvedeva's character admitted it: she had fallen in love. ''In my soul, I feel contentment and joy when I think of you,'' she wrote. Two days later the plot took its essential twist: her boss notified her that she had a vacation due. She wanted to visit her new man. The July 16 message began, in imperfect English, ''I with trembling heart waited your letter.'' Then came the rub. Can you help with travel costs? Anatoly Platonov, the spokesman for the K Department of Russia's Ministry of Internal Affairs, which investigates Internet crimes, said that the criminals who send these messages were almost always men and that they used the same scripts to correspond with hundreds, even thousands, of foreign men at once. The person posing as Ms. Medvedeva was simultaneously flirting with Mr. Palin, having found his personal advertisement on yahoo.com. He received virtually identical e-mail, the only changes being his name and short answers to questions he had posed in previous exchanges. (''I with trembling heart waited your letter'' arrived on July 27.) To lead the men into the trap, the poser sent them e-mail about a nervous wait for an American visa, and then a copy of the visa after it was approved. The visa was a forgery, made from a scan of an authentic visa, retouched by computer to include a new face and personal data. A trace of its number found that the original had been reported lost or stolen in August of last year, the American diplomat said. The ruse worked. Both Mr. Rammer and Mr. Palin wired Ms. Medvedeva money to help with costs. Mr. Rammer sent $300; Mr. Palin $720. The identity of the person who duped them remains unknown, although whoever it was has been active: Ms. Medvedeva is listed as a phony bride-to-be on Internet blacklists, which are regularly updated by bilked men. Her picture has also been used under the name Tatyana Kuzminyh and Anna Kruglova. Mr. Platonov said Ms. Medvedeva's ever changing character fit a type. The fictional women are like Legos, assembled by joining random photographs, vignettes and seductive scripts. The men who create them often have female accomplices who provide their passports for scanning or pick up money at Western Union counters or banks. The first ring the authorities broke up, in 2002, consisted of two young men and a woman who sent e-mail from the city of Yoshkar-Ola, in the Ural Mountains. ''We arrested the fat girl and she gave evidence,'' Mr. Platonov said, referring to the woman in the group. ''It turned out that all this effort was organized by a 21-year-old boy.'' In the most recent case, prosecuted this year, a husband-and-wife team in Chelyabinsk bilked foreign men out of several hundred thousand dollars, Mr. Platonov said. The wife posed as the bait. The man was found guilty of fraud, but his case is on appeal, a spokesman at the local Internal Affairs office said. The American diplomat says the swindle appears to have been picked up by copycats who have grown more sophisticated of late. The scripts have become more patient and include story lines that show a character's honesty or kindness. (Ms. Medvedeva described treating an orphan's toothache during a blackout -- by flashlight.) The visa forgeries have also become more convincing. Moreover, some swindlers have created Web sites that purport to represent travel agencies and back them up with ''employees'' who take calls from foreign men asking about their date's airfare and reservations. Others have turned to new classes of victims. Three weeks ago, the diplomat said, the first gay victims began to complain.", "title": "Russian Gal Seeking Comrade?

The killing shocked the Netherlands, already apprehensive over large-scale Muslim immigration, which has provoked an angry public debate. Mr. van Gogh's film added to that debate after it was broadcast in September. Shortly after the killing, the police arrested a 26-year-old man of dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality, whom they refused to identify. It was not immediately clear if he had any connections to militant groups, but the police said he was not known to any Dutch law enforcement agency and that he had not been under surveillance. Before fleeing, the man left a note on the body of the victim, said Eric Vermeulen, a spokesman for the Amsterdam police. The police declined to describe the contents of the message. The Dutch news media reported that it contained passages from the Koran. Mr. van Gogh, 47, a distant relative of the 19th century painter Vincent van Gogh, had received death threats after the broadcast of the short TV film, ''Submission.'' He made the movie with Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali-born refugee who fled an arranged marriage and ended up in the Netherlands, where she is now a member of the Dutch Parliament. Mr. van Gogh and Ms. Hirsi Ali, who wrote the script, have both criticized the conservative Muslim clergy for perpetuating views that are anti-women and anti-homosexual. Their 10-minute film presented the stories of four women who, while saying their prayers, describe to God the sexual and physical abuse they have suffered at the hands of the men in their lives. The actresses have Koranic verses dealing with women written on their bare skin, and some have traces of lashings painted on their bodies. Mr. van Gogh, a prolific filmmaker, columnist and writer who dealt with a range of subjects but always mocked hypocrisy, also published a book titled ''Allah Knows Better,'' a scathing critique of Islamic militants and clergy, whom he called woman haters. Ms. Hirsi Ali, who has lived under police protection for two years, said she and Mr. Van Gogh received death threats after the film was broadcast. ''Theo did not want any police protection,'' she said in a telephone interview. ''He often insisted on the need to preserve our freedom of speech. He said he would only report the threats to the police.'' Asked if she and Mr. van Gogh had discussed the death threats, she said: ''He told me, Ayaan, if they kill me, remember the rule of law has to be protected against extremists.'' The man suspected of killing Mr. van Gogh fired several shots at about 8:30 a.m., then crossed the street and stabbed him several times with a knife, a police spokesman said. Witnesses told the police that the assailant then stuck a note on his victim's chest with the knife. He then ran into a nearby park, which was quickly cordoned off by the police. As he emerged, he fired at the police. In a brief ensuing gunfight, both the suspect and a policeman were wounded, the police spokesman said. Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende called for calm and asked people to let investigators do their job before jumping to conclusions. ''Nothing is known about the motive,'' he said in written statement. Mr. Balkenende described the filmmaker as a man of ''outspoken opinions,'' and added that it would be deplorable for a difference of opinion to lead to murder. A memorial called by the mayor of Amsterdam, Job Cohen, was held Tuesday night on Dam Square, in the center of the city. The crowd was estimated at more than 20,000 people. ''We are all so sad and baffled that you can get killed for your opinion,'' Tilly Hermans, director of the Augustus Publishing, said in a telephone interview. ''Theo had strong opinions, but in our democracy we had become used to fighting for our opinion with our voices or our pens.'' She said people were worried about possible repercussions and the political mood in the country. In a recent survey, many Dutch said they feared the growing number of Muslims and the possibility that Islamic militants might be among them. Close to a million of the country's 16 million people are Muslim immigrants or their descendants. The center-right government has recently tightened immigration laws and pressed immigrants to try harder to integrate by taking language and citizenship classes. Immigrants often say it is hard to assimilate in a country where many people do not want them. Members of immigrant groups in Amsterdam representing Moroccan and Turkish associations condemned the killing and pleaded for dialogue. ''Escalation is in no one's best interest,'' a spokesman for a Moroccan group said. The killing evoked the slaying of the populist right-wing politician Pim Fortuyn, who, like Mr. van Gogh, talked openly about taboo subjects, including Islam and immigration. Mr. Fortuyn, who had gained a large following and wanted to become prime minister, was killed by an environmental activist in May 2002, just days before national elections. By coincidence, Mr. van Gogh had just completed a film about the life and ideas of Pim Fortuyn, which was to be released in December. On Tuesday, friends and associates of Mr. van Gogh debated on radio and television why he had not taken the death threats seriously. ''Either he underestimated the danger or he did not want to be scared by it -- I rather think the latter,'' said Nelleke Noordervliet, a writer who knew Mr. van Gogh well. Mr. van Gogh had many admirers and critics. ''Life will be a lot more boring without him,'' said Eveline van Dijck, a producer who worked with him.", "title": "Dutch Filmmaker, an Islam Critic, Is Killed"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Netherlands", "Top/News/World", "Top/News/World/Europe", "Top/Features/Movies", "Top/Features/Movies/News and Features", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Media, Entertainment and Publishing", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe/Netherlands"], "publication_day_of_month": "3", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Movies; World", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Foreign Desk", "print_page_number": "5", "publication_day_of_week": "Wednesday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/03/international/europe/03dutch.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "03DUTC$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "From the ode to Skunk Man: He is wondering why you're crying He thanks you for your kindness He was young here once and loving life His troubles and his strife Came early and came later. The poet wrote the tribute in her head in the shower on the day last January when Jeffrey T. Thompson, 57 -- known around here as Skunk Man because of the white streak running through his curly black mane -- was killed. The poet, Stanette Marie Rose, a financial adviser who had known Mr. Thompson since she was a girl, was one of many in Maple Valley who said they were sickened by that winter killing. After it happened, the people here said prayers, painted watercolor portraits, held candlelight vigils and memorial services, and built him a makeshift grave. Their intense interest in the case, the police say, helped lead to an arrest last week. All for Maple Valley's lone homeless man. Mr. Thompson, a Vietnam veteran who grew up near here and played as a child along the Cedar River, where he later slept and died, was adopted by this town of 14,000 people in rural King County, 25 miles southeast of Seattle. The homeless are not often welcome in many cities. But here in Maple Valley, where there was only one homeless man, it was different. He was a nuisance, but he was their nuisance; they rarely called the police to report him and they tolerated his living in the streets here for almost 30 years. They fed him, gave him odd jobs, bought him clothes and tall cups of coffee and counted on him to tell them crazy stories and even lend them books from his vast collection. After living for decades in this town's hidden corners, behind its gas stations and under its old railroad bridges, Mr. Thompson was embraced as an official denizen of Maple Valley, a kind of townwide cause, a likeable, visible man who usually wore fatigues and who happened to not have a home. ''He was our Jeff,'' said Sue VanRuff, executive director of the Greater Maple Valley-Black Diamond Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Thompson lived for a time behind Ms. VanRuff's Chevron Station on the Maple Valley Highway. To the people of Maple Valley, he was a sometimes obnoxious (he was arrested at least once), heavy-drinking, lively and entertaining vagabond, who was very picky about his coffee (tall Americanos, with extra cream). He was a man with so many stories, mostly about his service in Vietnam, and so many nicknames: Skunk Man, Stripe, Spot, Cedar River Man or, simply, the Bum. He chose to live on the streets, said residents and his somewhat estranged brother, Merlin Thompson, who lives not far from Maple Valley. They surmised that his life began to unravel after he left Vietnam, where he was a mechanic and served two tours of duty. Last January, prosecutors say, Mr. Thompson was beaten and stomped to death. The case went unsolved for eight months, as detectives from the King County Sheriff's Office pursued the case, relying heavily on tips from residents who had watched out for Mr. Thompson, as well as DNA evidence. Some Maple Valley residents said they had wondered if the detectives would be aggressive about solving the killing of a homeless man. Last week, Shirin Galinkin, 27, and David Pulcino, 45, who the police say got into an argument with Mr. Thompson down at the river, were arrested and charged with second-degree murder. They are being held awaiting arraignment. Sgt. John Urquhart, a spokesman for the King County Sheriff's Office, said the town's involvement in the case was crucial. ''There was a tremendous amount of interest in the investigation and sympathy for Thompson,'' Sergeant Urquhart said. Jim Flynn, the deputy mayor of Maple Valley, who knew Mr. Thompson well, said: ''It's hard for people to understand why we care so much about him. But he was here for so long and we just miss him.'' Mr. Flynn was visiting a memorial to Mr. Thompson, a wooden cross that was driven into an embankment along the river by a 16-year-old resident, Jennifer Smith, who said she was close to the Skunk Man and organized a candlelight vigil there that drew 50 people after he died. With her grandmother, she raised a $200 reward for anyone who could help catch the killer. Residents' research also helped to determine that Mr. Thompson was indeed a veteran and was entitled to government benefits that would cover the costs of his interment and allow a service with full military honors, which drew 60 people. The white wooden cross was adorned with plastic flowers and a small stuffed animal skunk. At the liquor store on the Maple Valley Highway, the closest business to Mr. Thompson's slapdash home under an old railroad trestle, a sign now says, ''Jeff's Killers' Caught! Thank you, King County Detectives.'' Joan Holder and her daughter, Marie Kimball, who manage the store, often allowed Mr. Thompson to come inside and get warm. They also provided information in the case, when they said that a couple from out of town had used a nearby pay phone, prompting detectives to trace the calls, law enforcement officials said. ''The last six weeks of his life, we were his hangout,'' said Ms. Kimball, 60, fighting back tears. ''All of Maple Valley was his home. He used to summer at McDonald's and winter down here.'' The arrests have awakened new memories of Mr. Thompson, who would often be seen around the streets, asking for a ride or for work. People are telling stories, digging out their poems, their musings and their paintings. ''People responded on a very deep level to his soul,'' said Ms. Rose, who wrote the poem about Mr. Thompson after he died, which she titled ''Cedar River Man.'' ''That's kind of the magic of the whole thing.'' The poem ends this way: And now this boy is free He is splashing and he is dancing He is laughing and wondering Did you love me? I am the Cedar River Man.

California defended its policy, which the federal appeals court in San Francisco upheld, as necessary to prevent violence in a gang-ridden prison system. ''California is ground zero for race-based street gangs,'' Frances T. Grunder, a senior assistant state attorney general, told the justices. ''The animosity between the gangs is purely race-based, and the racial pressures in prison are very, very severe.'' More than 25 years ago, California adopted the practice of placing inmates in double cells with cellmates of the same ethnic background for the first 60 days after their arrival at a prison, either as newcomers to the system or following a transfer from another prison. The inmates are evaluated during that time for propensity to violence, among other things, and then are assigned permanent quarters on a nonracial basis. Neither the federal Bureau of Prisons nor any other state follows such a policy, which the lawyer for a black inmate who challenged the system described as nothing more than ''routine, blanket racial segregation.'' The lawyer, Bert H. Deixler, said it was based on a ''needless and dangerous'' stereotype that assumed that all members of a racial or ethnic group acted and thought alike. California applied the policy last year to segregate 40,000 new prison inmates and several hundred thousand others who were transferred between prisons. On Tuesday, several justices questioned the rationale for applying the policy to transferred inmates. ''What's the justification?'' Justice David H. Souter asked Ms. Grunder, observing that by the time of a transfer, prison officials had had ''plenty of time'' to assess an inmate's potential for violence. Justice Antonin Scalia was openly skeptical of the policy's application to transfers despite his apparent willingness to accept it for new inmates. Justice John Paul Stevens wondered aloud whether placing inmates of the same race together might have the effect of increasing gang membership, by facilitating close contact between potential members of the same gang. Garrison S. Johnson, the inmate who brought the lawsuit, is a black man who chose not to join a prison gang. ''There is no record that he has ever been involved in interracial violence,'' his lawyer, Mr. Deixler, told the court. In prison since 1987, Mr. Johnson has been transferred five times, meaning he has encountered six periods of segregation. ''He is in peril, unable to reach out across racial lines for support,'' Mr. Deixler said. The Bush administration entered the case on Mr. Johnson's behalf to argue that segregation by race should always be regarded as presumptively unconstitutional and subject to the most exacting level of judicial scrutiny. The question in the case, Johnson v. California, No. 03-636, is what standard of judicial review should apply to the policy. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in upholding it, applied the more deferential standard that the Supreme Court has developed for evaluating choices made by prison administrators. Both the inmate's lawyer and the administration are arguing that when it comes to race, the deferential stance should not apply. Instead, they maintain, ''strict scrutiny'' should apply to prison policies that classify people by race, as to any such policies by government in any setting. Under strict scrutiny, a policy will be upheld only if it is narrowly tailored to achieve a ''compelling'' government interest. ''This case provides an opportunity to reaffirm that all government policies based on race are subject to strict scrutiny,'' Paul D. Clement, the acting solicitor general, told the justices. Mr. Clement said the federal Bureau of Prisons made housing assignments for prisoners based not on their race but on an individual evaluation drawn largely from the presentencing report that is prepared after conviction. The strict-scrutiny position fits with the Bush administration's general view that race-conscious policies like affirmative action are constitutionally impermissible. Mr. Clement said the California policy would fail even a deferential standard of review if that standard were properly applied, but he tried to keep the justices focused on the strict-scrutiny argument. If the court agrees that strict scrutiny should apply, it will most likely return the case to the Ninth Circuit with instructions to re-evaluate the policy under that standard.

But the final and smallest catch was particularly disheartening. A three-inch fingerling fished out of Dogue Creek, 15 miles south of here, at the beginning of October indicates that the snakehead is reproducing in local waters that are beloved by bass fishermen. Two years ago the federal government outlawed the importing of the northern snakehead, a delicacy in Chinese and Thai cuisine that goes by names like mudfish. But the fish, which can grow to several feet, is resilient. It can breathe air and survive out of water for a prolonged period. And it has the ability, when young, to wriggle through mud overland from one body of water to another. With the evidence of the fish's spawning, hope is fading along the Potomac that the aggressive, toothy Asian invader can be readily stopped. The snakehead made cameo appearances throughout the summer from Massapoag Pond in Massachusetts to the Chicago shores of Lake Michigan, and it is spawning in Meadow Lake, a South Philadelphia pond that drains into the Schuylkill. In those places, state fish and game agencies hope they can keep it from establishing a biological beachhead. There is a bit more resignation here, not far from the Maryland pond where the snakehead's first appearance caused alarm two years ago. ''Obviously, you can't poison the Potomac and you can't drain it,'' said Walter R. Courtenay Jr., a research fishery biologist at the United States Geological Survey's Center for Aquatic Resources Studies in Gainesville, Fla., referring to the techniques used to purge snakehead from two local ponds. Though an unwelcome addition to the ecosystem, the fish may not wreak the kind of devastation envisioned when it was first called Frankenfish. The snakehead may be problematic for native fisheries, Mr. Courtenay said, but it is too soon to gauge the impact. ''What they are going to go for will be fish that don't try to get away from them and some of the slower-moving species,'' he said, and primarily the young, ''probably shad or perch or bass.'' In an e-mail message to a scientific colleague, which Mr. Courtenay made available, he said, ''There will likely be changes in populations of some native fishes,'' but those changes may be over decades. ''The fact remains,'' Mr. Courtenay continued, ''this nation does not need predators of foreign origin introduced to any of our waters, no matter the reason or by some accident. Our native fishes are too stressed already due to human activities to face additional threats.'' The Web site of the United States Geological Survey sounds a louder alarm. ''Should snakeheads become established in North American ecosystems,'' it says, ''their predatory behavior could drastically disrupt food webs and ecological conditions, thus forever changing native aquatic systems by modifying the array of native species.'' The snakehead is hardly the first invader in the nation's rivers. On the Mississippi River, two species of invasive Asian carp have cut into native fisheries from Arkansas to a little south of Chicago over the last decade. The northern snakehead, like the Asian carp and the zebra mussels in the Great Lakes, is a byproduct of global commerce. The transformation of native ecosystems by such foreign invaders is increasingly hard to escape, experts say. Gary Martel, the director of fisheries for Virginia, said, ''Realistically, if you look at the distribution of the fish -- they are on both sides of the Potomac River over a space of 13 miles or so -- with the number we have gotten, the possibility of catching all the fish and removing them is not practical.'' ''We don't know how it's going to fit in with those other organisms,'' Mr. Martel said. ''It's at the top of the food chain, not the bottom. It eats other fish, insects at small stages, amphibians -- just about anything that inhabits the same environment as it does.'' By the time the snakehead was banned, Mr. Courtenay said, the current populations had probably already gained a toehold in the Potomac, whose bass fishery is a source of great local pride. Mr. Courtenay said the first local snakeheads could have been discarded or intentionally released -- perhaps as part of a Buddhist ceremony called prayer animal release. Steven Early, a biologist with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, is not ready to acknowledge defeat. ''I know we've got a juvenile out there, and that probably means we've got more than one juvenile,'' Mr. Early said. ''It doesn't mean that they're established. Even if they were, that would be a very low level.'' He added: ''I am concerned that in this area this fish is going to compete directly with largemouth bass -- prey on them, compete for food and occupy the same habitat -- and there's only enough habitat to go around; it's like musical chairs. And my largemouth bass recreational fishery is very precious.'' Those who love the fishery can be recruited to try to protect it. ''Anglers and fishermen,'' Mr. Early said, ''if well directed and efficient, can fish out a fish; so I think there are a couple of cards yet to be played.''", "title": "Spawning of Interloper Fish In Potomac Worries Experts"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/U.S.", "Top/News", "Top/News/Science/Environment", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Activities and Interests/Eco-tourism"], "publication_day_of_month": "3", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "U.S.", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "National Desk", "print_page_number": "12", "publication_day_of_week": "Wednesday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/03/national/03snakehead.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "03SNAK$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "The lead defense lawyer in the Scott Peterson murder trial, Mark Geragos, urged jurors on Tuesday to put aside any hatred for his client's boorish ways. He told them instead to ponder the still unexplained death of Mr. Peterson's wife, Laci, a killing for which he said there were no witnesses, no evidence of a fatal struggle, no murder weapon and no motive. In his rapid-fire closing argument, Mr. Geragos summarized the case much the way he had begun, conceding that Mr. Peterson, charged with killing his wife and her fetus, could clearly be viewed as a ''jerk'' and a ''liar.'' ''Do you all hate him?'' Mr. Geragos asked. ''If you hate him, then maybe what they're asking you to do is just convict him.'' But disdain is no basis for convicting a man of murder, he said. Throughout the morning session of his summation, Mr. Geragos offered a point-by-point response to the prosecution's emotional closing argument a day earlier, using evidence and testimony from the early phases of the trial to remind jurors that the police had received full cooperation from Mr. Peterson and yet failed to investigate a string of leads or pursue other potential suspects. ''If you presume this guy is guilty, you can put a sinister spin on anything,'' said Mr. Geragos, later reminding jurors, ''You must not be influenced by sentiment, conjecture or passion.'' The prosecution argued that Mr. Peterson killed his pregnant wife to escape the drudgery of married life and fatherhood, all in an effort to follow a fantasy to lead the life a wealthy jet-set bachelor, free to travel the world seeking adventure. But in his closing, Mr. Geragos sprinted through a series of other explanations for all of Mr. Peterson's contradictory statements and erratic behavior after his wife disappeared on or around Dec. 23, 2002. For example, Mr. Geragos replayed the period around the time of Ms. Peterson's disappearance. He pointed to little-discussed facts like confiscated records on Internet activity the morning Ms. Peterson may have disappeared, showing that someone had been looking at a Gap advertisement and printing French toast recipes. Mr. Geragos argued that those facts proved that Ms. Peterson was home and alive on Dec. 24, when Mr. Peterson left for a brief fishing trip. ''The one rational explanation was that she was alive when Scott Peterson left that morning,'' Mr. Geragos said. He said that meant, ''You have only one conclusion and that conclusion is that Scott Peterson is not guilty.'' Mr. Geragos, offering an animated presentation punctuated by visual aids, had some jurors shaking their heads in agreement as he discussed some of the 41 points the prosecutors cited as evidence in its case, which posited that Mr. Peterson killed his wife at home, used hand-made cement anchors to weigh her body down and then dumped it in San Francisco Bay. Mr. Geragos reminded jurors of court testimony indicating that Mr. Peterson was eager to have a child and that the couple had been trying for months. And he addressed Mr. Peterson's boating habits and affair with his mistress, Amber Frey, and the prosecution's theory that Mr. Peterson stood to inherit his wife's money. ''They called no less than four witnesses to suggest that there was a financial motive,'' Mr. Geragos said, adding that Mr. Peterson clearly stood to gain more if his wife remained alive. She was set to inherit nearly $1 million, but Mr. Peterson was not first in line to receive that money if she died. ''There was no motive for him to kill Laci and Conner whatsoever,'' Mr. Geragos said. ''In fact, on the contrary.'' The defense will finish closing arguments early on Wednesday, followed by a rebuttal by the prosecution.

But on Tuesday, as news spread that a quarter of the city's water customers faced shutoff, it was suddenly the water bill that prompted several panicked calls. ''It is a huge concern,'' Ms. Chandler said. ''The calls that I've had today, the people are $600 behind, $800 behind. They're huge amounts, much more than we could possibly help with.'' On the heels of hard-won water rate and sales tax increases to pay for $3 billion in sewer improvements, the Atlanta Department of Watershed Management has decided to rein in its debtors. On Thursday, two dozen workers began turning off the water of customers who were more than 30 days delinquent, estimated to be about a quarter of the city's 134,000 active accounts. A spokeswoman for the department, Janet Ward, said that the delinquency period was nothing new but that strict enforcement was. Ms. Ward said that anyone who contested their bill would probably be able to keep their water on until the dispute was concluded. ''We understand how important water is, and we will bend over backwards to work with people who should not have their water cut off,'' she said. But she said the debt could not be ignored. ''We have passed these incredible rate increases that took effect in January, and then the people voted overwhelmingly to pass a municipal rate increase of a 1 percent sales tax,'' Ms. Ward said. In January, the City Council approved yearly rate increases until 2008, on a sliding scale that will eventually triple rates for the biggest water users. ''We're asking the people to step up to the plate, and they have done that,'' she said. ''Now we need to make sure and make them understand that we are doing everything we can to keep their rates down and do the work that has to be done. Recovering money that is by rights ours and that is out there is one of the best ways to do that.'' It is unclear how much of the $35 million that those customers owe will be recovered, but at least it will stop the bleeding, she said. The department will shut off about 400 to 500 delinquents a day until the backlog is eliminated. The logic is little comfort to those who fear they will be cut off. Elaine Isles, 44, is an unemployed security guard who lives with her husband, Glenn, and their three sons, ages 17, 10 and 7, and their water bill is past due. Ms. Isles received assistance for last month, but carried a balance forward and now has the next month's bill as well. ''Now I owe $238.34,'' Ms. Isles said. ''I don't have a way to give them $238.34. I don't have any way to give them one dollar.'' The family has been trying to cut down, flushing the toilet less. ''They already knew people weren't going to be able to pay their water bill when they increased it,'' she said. ''Then they threaten the people of Atlanta and say if you're 30 days past due we're going to cut your water off. I think it's ridiculous.'' Reflecting an irony of the city's water politics, Ms. Isles and her family are the very people the increase was designed to help. The sewer system is notoriously broken in places, in heavy rains dumping sewage into the Chattahoochee River and backing up plumbing in neighborhoods like the Isleses'. A federal judge had threatened a moratorium on new sewer hookups if it was not fixed. The plumbing backups have ''been hard on me and my family,'' Ms. Isles said. ''The plumber said it's not in our property but in the street. I called the city but the city doesn't do anything.'' She would appreciate it being fixed, she said, but is unhappy that she should be told to pay so much. ''How can they say that when I can't pay for it?'' she said. ''I can't pay.'' Many customers were caught off guard by the news, said Ms. Chandler of the assistance center, not only because enforcement had been lax but also because the utility just changed from a two-month billing cycle to once a month. ''Also, a lot of landlords who previously did not charge tenants for water now are charging,'' she said. ''That's a whole new thing.'' Councilman C.T. Martin said elderly and low-income people had been severely affected by the rate increase, which began in January. Mr. Martin had a colleague propose a resolution for him on Monday night that would protect those groups from immediate shutoffs. ''It's going to cause some people to have to move out of the city,'' Mr. Martin said. ''It's just kind of the way the whole thing was done. There hadn't been adequate notification and education.'' The water department is beginning a notification program with phone calls and bill inserts, Ms. Ward said. She said they would start cutoffs with ''the worst of the worst.'' ''They're the ones who've owed the most, and they've owed it the longest time,'' Ms. Ward said. That includes people who are anywhere from 60 or 90 days overdue to years, she said. ''I've seen some numbers, in the thousands of dollars, $8,000, $9,000 for individual residential accounts,'' she said. ''These are people who have never paid a bill, or some people who move or something and we don't catch up with them.'' For now, that is what people like Irene Gorman, 42, are counting on. Ms. Gorman is a single mother of four and a pharmacy technician at a CVS store who lives in Vine City, a low-income neighborhood in central Atlanta. Ms. Gorman has been paying down a past due water bill at $80 a week. She has trimmed it to $282, but she is struggling to make the payments. Ms. Gorman said she did not know what would happen if she could not pay and received a cutoff notice. ''It's hard to pay my bills right now,'' she said.

The move should clear the way for Nextel to receive final approval for a swap of spectrum that Verizon Wireless had opposed. Nextel will also drop its opposition to Verizon Wireless's using the phrase ''push to talk'' in marketing its walkie-talkie service. By dropping their lawsuits, the companies can now focus on the more pressing issue of how to compete with Cingular Wireless, the joint venture of BellSouth and SBC that became the industry leader last month when regulators approved its purchase of AT&T Wireless. ''The biggest things on their minds have to be how to capitalize on the opportunity and threat from the merger of Cingular and AT&T Wireless,'' said John Ryan, the president of RHK, a telecommunications consultancy in San Francisco. ''It's now a monster.'' In July, over Verizon Wireless's objections, the Federal Communications Commission decided that Nextel should give back part of its 800-megahertz spectrum because some Nextel calls over the spectrum were interfering with some public safety communications. In return, the F.C.C. said Nextel would receive 1.9-gigahertz spectrum and pay $4.8 billion to swap the appropriate licenses. Verizon Wireless argued that any spectrum Nextel acquired should be through an auction, and that the government's plan amounted to a private sale of public assets. Proceeds from any sale, the company said, should go to the Treasury or be set aside by Congress for public safety. Nextel could still face other legal challenges, though most analysts say they believe that the company has cleared its highest hurdle to resolving the issue. At the same time, Nextel dropped its claim that Verizon Wireless infringed on its trademark by using ''Push to Talk,'' ''PTT,'' and ''PUSH'' when promoting its walkie-talkie phone service. Nextel uses similar phrases to publicize its highly successful service, which allows cellphones to double as two-way radios.

The company lost $1.01 billion, or 73 cents a share, in the quarter, after losing $23 million, or 2 cents a share, in the period a year ago. The loss came despite a 20 percent rise in revenue, to $2.86 billion, from $2.38 billion in the third quarter of 2003, thanks to the addition of a record number of new subscribers. DirecTV, which is 34 percent owned by the News Corporation, plans to launch four new satellites during the next three years to increase its high-definition and other programming. During the quarter, the company reconfigured two of these satellites to provide television instead of Internet services, and, in revaluing them, took a $903 million one-time after-tax charge. DirecTV executives said in a conference call with analysts yesterday that they were pleased that customers had spent on average $66.46 a month in the quarter, a 4 percent increase. They also said they were happy with the record 484,000 new customers that DirecTV had added in the quarter, a 49 percent jump from the period last year. The growth, the executives said, came at the expense of DirecTV's primary rivals, the cable companies. ''How close is the battle between cable and DirecTV?'' said Mitch Stern, the chief executive of DirecTV's satellite operations. ''Clearly, we are not seeing a polarized nation when it comes to choosing television.'' It's ''a landslide'' in favor of satellite providers, he said. Even so, the company and industry analysts expressed concern about the rise in turnover among customers, many of whom were dropped for not paying their bills. DirecTV said it was trying to fix this problem by doing a better job of screening customers' credit ratings. The company also said that competition with cable companies had ''reached a new level of intensity,'' and that DirecTV was adding more local programming and digital video recorders to give customers more reasons to not change television providers.

More than 100 witnesses have testified during nearly two years of proceedings in the most serious terrorism trial in Canadian history. A special high-security courtroom was built for the case, at a cost of $6 million, complete with a prisoner dock encased in bulletproof glass. Aging relatives of the victims came from as far away as Sri Lanka to watch from the court gallery. But as prosecutors opened their final arguments on Monday to convict two Canadian Sikh activists accused of plotting the bombing, the outcome of the trial is far from settled because of years of bungled police work and the unexplained killings of an important witness and suspect. In addition, important witnesses offered vague and contradictory recollections, and crucial evidence is circumstantial. Both defendants -- Ripudaman Singh Malik, 57, a millionaire real estate entrepreneur, and Ajaib Singh Bagri, 56, a sawmill worker and Sikh preacher -- pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy in the bombing of the jet, Air India Flight 182 en route from Toronto and Montreal to Bombay, now known as Mumbai, on June 23, 1985. The two are also charged with conspiring in an explosion that killed two baggage handlers at Narita Airport outside Tokyo 54 minutes before Flight 182 went down. Prosecutors said both bombs had been placed on Air India aircraft in Vancouver. ''This was a murder plot in which two planes were to explode simultaneously,'' Robert H. Wright, the chief prosecutor, said as he began to sum up his case. ''It is difficult to comprehend how this would happen. Who would do something so terrible?'' Answering his own question, Mr. Wright told the court that only ''political and religious zealotry'' could motivate such a crime. Prosecutors say Mr. Malik, who has worn a white tunic at the trial, recruited members of the plot and gave $3,000 to a friend to pick up tickets for the flight with the ultimate intention of planting the bomb on Flight 182. Mr. Bagri, who wears a dark turban, is accused of taking luggage with the explosives to the Vancouver airport. Neither Mr. Malik nor Mr. Bagri chose to testify. Prosecutors have alleged that Mr. Malik and Mr. Bagri were motivated to revenge the 1984 Indian Army storming of the Golden Temple of Amritsar after the holy shrine was taken over by militant Sikhs. That attack sparked a cascade of violence and revenge killings that included the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. With no physical evidence or firsthand testimony linking the accused to the bombing, the outcome of the trial is in doubt. The prosecution wraps up its case in the next few weeks, and Justice Ian Bruce Josephson is expected to reach a decision early next year. The prosecution has shown a video of Mr. Bagri giving an incendiary speech at a Sikh rally in New York in July 1984 in which he said, ''We will not take rest until we kill 50,000 Hindus.'' But most of the prosecution's case is based on supposed confessions Mr. Malik and Mr. Bagri gave to several associates, ones that they deny making. The government has highlighted statements made by a Canadian Security Intelligence Service agent that a friend of Mr. Bagri said he had visited her the night before the bombing to ask to borrow her car to drop off some bags at the airport. By court order, the woman, like other crucial witnesses, cannot be identified. The agent testified that the woman had said that Mr. Bagri implied that wrongdoing would be done, but during the trial she said she did not remember making such statements. Justice Josephson ruled that the woman's prior testimony should be admitted as evidence after the prosecution argued that witnesses were coming under pressure from Sikh activists. The crucial prosecution witness against Mr. Malik is a former employee at a religious school that Mr. Malik directed. She testified that he told her in 1996 and 1997, while they were involved in a strong personal, but platonic, relationship that he helped organize the conspiracy and detailed his role in arranging for the purchase and pickup of airline tickets that were used to check in the baggage with the explosives. The witness said she had distanced herself from him after the admissions, after which she was subjected to threats. She was eventually fired. Mr. Malik's lawyer questioned her credibility as a dissatisfied employee. The prosecution has also been hampered by the fact that the suspected ringleader of the plot, a former Canadian resident, Talwinder Singh Parmar, was killed by the Indian authorities when they caught him clandestinely crossing from Pakistan in 1992. Tara Singh Hayer, the publisher of a Sikh newspaper in Vancouver, told the police in 1995 that he had overheard Mr. Bagri admit to his role in the attacks. But three years later, Mr. Hayer was gunned down outside his home in a Vancouver suburb.", "title": "Trial in '85 Jet Blast Nears End in Canada"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Canada", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/India", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Japan", "Top/News/World", "Top/News/World/Americas", "Top/News/World/Asia Pacific", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Manufacturing, Operations and Logistics", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Law Enforcement and Security", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia/India", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/Canada", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Asia/Japan", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/Canada/British Columbia/Vancouver", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/Canada/British Columbia"], "publication_day_of_month": "3", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "World", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Foreign Desk", "print_page_number": "8", "publication_day_of_week": "Wednesday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/03/international/americas/03canada.html", "print_column": "4", "slug": "03CANA$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Insurgents blew up a northern oil export pipeline on Tuesday, dealing a severe blow to the national economy, even as car bombs and gun battles across the country left at least 12 Iraqis dead, Iraqi officials said. The sabotage of the northern oil pipeline forced a shutdown of crude oil exports to a port in Turkey, Iraqi officials said. The pipeline pumps out 400,000 barrels a day of crude oil and is the frequent target of sabotage. Hours after the explosion, firefighters were still battling the pipeline blaze near the city of Kirkuk, where pipelines run from oil fields west to the country's largest refinery in Bayji and north to Turkey. An Iraqi oil official in Baghdad told The Associated Press that the amount of crude oil in storage at the port of Ceyhan in Turkey was down to four million barrels, half of the port's storage capacity. The attacks on oil pipelines near Kirkuk and around Basra in the south, where the oil fields are much more extensive, have sharply cut into Iraq's main economic hope. American and Iraqi officials are relying on steady oil exports to help revive the stagnant economy in a country where the unemployment rate hovers at 60 percent. The Arab news network Al Jazeera reported Tuesday night that it had received a new videotape in which the kidnappers of a British-Iraqi aid official, Margaret Hassan, threaten to turn her over to the group led by the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi within 48 hours if Britain does not withdraw its troops from Iraq. In the first of the bombings on Tuesday, insurgents drove a car bomb up to the Ministry of Education offices in northwestern Baghdad in the morning, killing at least six people and wounding dozens more, said Col. Adnan Abdul-Rahman, an Interior Ministry spokesman. The blast took place in the Adhamiya neighborhood a Sunni-dominated area generally hostile to the Americans. People at the scene said two ministry guards in the parking lot, a father and his son, died immediately in the blast. In the volatile northern city of Mosul, a car bomb aimed at a military convoy near the police academy killed one person and wounded at least seven security officers, hospital officials said. The target appeared to be Maj. Gen. Rashid Flayeh, the commander of a special security force who had arrived in the city just days ago to assist the local police. He was unhurt in the blast, police officials said. At 1 p.m., another car bomb exploded by a convoy of Iraqi National Guardsmen in Mosul, killing two civilians and wounding seven others, hospital officials said. Clashes between insurgents and Iraqi guardsmen in the city's Widha neighborhood left three civilians dead, the officials said. The latest attacks came about halfway through the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan. During the holiday, the number of attacks in Iraq per day has spiked by 30 percent, and suicide car bombs appear to be an increasingly common weapon, American military officials say. Since April, when a two-front uprising convulsed the country, American-led forces have been unable to dampen what appears to be a growing insurgency, much of it led by disenfranchised Sunni Muslims ousted from power with the toppling of Saddam Hussein. In recent weeks, American military officials have been gathering their troops for a planned invasion of the insurgent stronghold of Falluja, 35 miles west of the capital, in the hopes that crushing that sanctuary will break the backbone of the insurgency. Thousands of rebels are believed to have dug into positions in the city, awaiting the assault. Prime Minister Ayad Allawi has said he is ready to call for a sweeping offensive in order to bring Falluja into his fold before elections scheduled for January. But Iraq's president, Sheik Ghazi al-Yawar, a leader of one of the largest Sunni tribes in the country, said in an interview with a Kuwaiti newspaper on Monday that he absolutely opposed any military action. The break between the two strong-willed men suggests that there could be enormous political fallout in Iraq if an invasion led by the American marines goes forward. Marines are now engaged in some of the most intense urban combat in the country in the provincial capital of Ramadi, 30 miles west of Falluja. There, insurgents have been ambushing Marine convoys that race daily through the downtown area. On Monday, a freelance cameraman working for Reuters, Dhia Najim, was shot and killed while covering the fighting in the area. The American military said in a statement on Tuesday that Mr. Najim had been killed during a battle between American marines and insurgents. Military officials said in interviews that the cameraman had been killed by the marines as they took fire from the insurgents. One official said marines had inspected Mr. Najim's camera after the battle and found footage that showed insurgents attacking convoys. By Tuesday night, the marines had opened an investigation, the official said. ''We did kill him,'' he said. ''He was out with the bad guys. He was there with them, they attacked, and we fired back and hit him.'' Reuters reported that its global managing editor, David Schlesinger, was strongly urging the American military to conduct a proper investigation and was dissatisfied with the military's statement. ''We reject the clear implication in the Marines' statement that Dhia was part of an insurgent group,'' he said. Mr. Najim's death brought to 36 the number of journalists who have been killed in Iraq, at least eight by American fire, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, based in New York. Nineteen have died from insurgent actions. Early Wednesday, Al Jazeera showed a short segment of a videotape of Ms. Hassan, the kidnapped aid worker, who was born in Dublin. The network said it was not broadcasting the complete tape because parts of it were too emotionally intense. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland said in the Irish Parliament that he had read a text of the video and that it appeared ''distressing.'' In the part shown, an insurgent wearing a dark track suit and a white cloth around his head was speaking while he held a Kalashnikov rifle. The network reported that he had said the group would turn Ms. Hassan over to Mr. Zarqawi's group within 48 hours if Britain did not withdraw its troops. The Press Association, a British news agency, quoted Mr. Ahern as saying that as in two previous videos, the new tape showed Ms. Hassan pleading for her life. She faints, and then a bucketful of water is thrown over her head, and she gets up and begins crying. News agencies reported Tuesday that two Iraqi guards kidnapped from an office on Monday in the affluent Baghdad neighborhood of Mansour had been released. Still missing are an unidentified American, a Nepalese and two other Iraqi guards, said Col. Abdul-Rahman, the Interior Ministry spokesman. The two released Iraqi guards were from the Falluja area, The A.P. reported. All work for a Saudi Arabian food supply company. More than 160 foreigners have been kidnapped this year in Iraq, most by bandits seeking ransom. More than 30 have been killed, some in grisly videotaped beheadings posted on the Internet. Mr. Zarqawi's militant group posted such a video on Tuesday showing the decapitation of Shosei Koda, a 24-year-old Japanese backpacker whose body was discovered in Baghdad on Saturday. Mr. Koda's body was wrapped in an American flag, and the video showed insurgents shoving him down on that flag and slicing off his head. In a separate Internet statement, the group, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, said the Japanese government had offered a ransom of ''millions of dollars'' but had refused to withdraw its 550 troops in Iraq, prompting the group to kill Mr. Koda. Also on Tuesday, a supervisor in the Iraqi electoral commission, Adel al-Lami, said voter registration lists had been distributed on Monday in parts of several cities, including Baghdad, Amara and Basra. Though Monday was the first day that Iraqis collecting their food rations could receive registration lists for verification, the distribution of such lists apparently did not take place at all 540 or so food centers around the country, Mr. Lami said. The commission still has until the end of November to complete its voter rolls.", "title": "Insurgents Blow Up an Iraqi Oil Pipeline"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Iraq", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Turkey", "Top/News/World", "Top/News/Washington", "Top/News/World/Middle East", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe/Turkey", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Middle East", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Middle East/Iraq"], "publication_day_of_month": "3", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "World; Washington", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Foreign Desk", "print_page_number": "6", "publication_day_of_week": "Wednesday", "print_section": "A", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/03/international/middleeast/03iraq.html", "print_column": "1", "slug": "03IRAQ$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "These are the facts: The Yankees blew a three-games-to-none lead in the American League Championship Series to the Boston Red Sox last month. Then the Red Sox won the World Series, forever changing the dynamic between the two rivals. But Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, would be happy to point out a few other facts. ''We have a 101-win team, we had the best record in the American League, we won the A.L. East and we lost a seven-game set in the A.L.C.S.,'' Cashman said yesterday. ''This is a championship-caliber club as it is. Is a huge housecleaning necessary? No.'' It is also not possible. The Yankees have weaknesses, Cashman said, and they are in the early stages of addressing them. But they are locked into expensive contracts with so many players that moving the pieces will be hard. ''Normally we have a lot of money coming off that contributes to a lot of flexibility,'' Cashman said. ''That's not the case this winter. We have guys signed, and guys have no-trade clauses. Our flexibility isn't as great as it's been in the past.'' To get around that, the Yankees will probably use two of their best assets: the cash of the principal owner George Steinbrenner and Manager Joe Torre's cool hand in the clubhouse. Steinbrenner will spend to add stars, and Torre will try to bring them together. More than ever, every Yankees move creates a ripple within the Red Sox' front office, and vice versa. The teams had the two highest payrolls in baseball last season, with the Yankees at $180 million and the Red Sox at $130 million. The Yankees' payroll seems destined to go well beyond $200 million next season, especially if they sign center fielder Carlos Beltran and a starter or two from a group that includes Carl Pavano, Eric Milton and David Wells. The Red Sox already have $100 million committed for next season, factoring in raises for the players under contract. Some of the players not included in that group are four prominent free agents: pitchers Pedro Mart\u00ednez and Derek Lowe, catcher Jason Varitek and shortstop Orlando Cabrera. ''It's nice to have some credibility coming off a winning season, but we face tough decisions,'' Boston General Manager Theo Epstein said yesterday. ''It's going to be hard to have as much talent, one through 25, in '05 as we had in '04. But we're going to do what we can to have a winning team.'' When they traded Nomar Garciaparra in July, the Red Sox showed that they would not be swayed by sentiment. That could be worth remembering in the case of Mart\u00ednez, who filed for free agency yesterday and could wind up with the Yankees. Mart\u00ednez went 16-9 last season and was exceptional in the World Series. But his earned run average rose to 3.90, and he earned $17.5 million. The Red Sox plan to offer him a contract based on his expected future performance, not on his past brilliance. Epstein would not address Mart\u00ednez's situation, but he spoke generally about the team's philosophy. ''We do everything with the team concept in mind,'' he said. ''As great as our resources are, there's a limit. We're going to operate within our budget and continue the same approach we used to build the '03 team and the '04 team. I'd love for all these guys to be back, but it's not realistic, given our limits. ''We'll stay true to our approach. We combine aggressiveness and fiscal responsibility.'' Next Monday, Cashman and Epstein will be among the executives flying to Key Biscayne, Fla., for the general managers' meetings, which start on Tuesday. On Nov. 12, teams can begin negotiating with other teams' free agents; until then, teams can only speak generally, without talking about money. Last year at the general managers' meetings, Cashman put together the framework of a deal for Javier Vazquez, then of the Montreal Expos. Despite his late-season struggles, Vazquez remains in the Yankees' plans, Cashman said. But like many Yankees, Vazquez might be difficult to trade even if they were willing. He has three years left on a four-year, $45 million deal. Other enormous salaries will be even harder to shed. Kevin Brown, the starter nobody seems to want back, is owed $15 million for next year and has a no-trade clause. Jason Giambi, the first baseman whose season was ruined by a variety of physical problems, is owed $82 million for the next four years. He, too, must approve any deal. The Yankees may try to sign a defensive first baseman to back up Giambi, with the familiar free agents Tino Martinez and John Olerud available. The Red Sox had success finding bargains in the past, and they will most likely look for more. The Mart\u00ednez saga could be another battleground between the Red Sox and the Yankees, but it may be the more subtle moves that make a bigger difference. ''The way we can compete with the Yankees is by having no bad players, by having depth at every position and a good bench,'' Epstein said. ''We can't afford a huge allowance to any one player and have that turn into a mistake.''

The latest trouble came early Tuesday when, officials with the World Food Program said, the Sudanese military and police surrounded two camps in the state of Southern Darfur, used tear gas to disperse crowds and began forcibly moving some people from the camps. Barry Came, a World Food Program spokesman in Khartoum, said in a telephone interview that government officials had told the United Nations agency that the crackdown was aimed at local people who infiltrated the camps to collect food rations meant for those who were displaced from their homes. Mr. Came said his agency had not been able to verify the government's claim. Roughly 60,000 people in the camps are out of reach for aid workers, he said. In New York, the United Nations envoy to Sudan, Jan Pronk, said the forced relocation was ''in flagrant violation of international humanitarian law'' and of agreements he had reached with the leaders of the Sudanese government. He said it was clear from his reports that the relocation was being directed by the Sudanese Army and the police. In a statement on Tuesday night, Secretary General Kofi Annan condemned the relocation and noted that it directly violated agreements Sudan had made with the United Nations. ''I strongly urge the government to halt immediately all such relocation operations and to facilitate the return of the affected persons from the inappropriate sites to which they have been taken,'' he said. Mr. Pronk is scheduled to give his monthly report on conditions in Darfur on Thursday to the Security Council, which has threatened to bring sanctions on the government and Sudan's oil industry if conditions do not improve. Earlier in the week, United Nations and many nongovernmental relief agencies pulled workers from the Jebel Mara region of the state of Western Darfur after a bus, apparently carrying civilians, was hijacked by unknown assailants and 18 Arab passengers were taken hostage. As a result, workers cannot directly serve some 160,000 displaced people there. A third patch, in the state of Northern Darfur, has been inaccessible to aid workers since October, when two workers with Save the Children, a British relief organization, were killed after their car hit a land mine. The United Nations refugee agency announced Tuesday at a briefing in Geneva that heightened violence had forced its workers in Darfur to cancel assessment missions that had been planned for this week. Since early 2003, the war in Darfur has pitted rebels, mainly from African tribes, against an Arab-led government in Khartoum, the capital, and its allied Arab militias in the west. The war has made roughly 1.6 million people homeless and killed countless civilians. More than 3,000 African Union troops have begun fanning out across Darfur to monitor a tenuous cease-fire. All the while, reports of violence against civilians, including those seeking refuge in government-run displaced people's camps, have continued to pour in.

So Jets Coach Herman Edwards turned his attention Tuesday to something that is just as important as running at the front of the pack: staying there. ''Right now, after seven games in the A.F.C., you have one of the best records,'' Edwards said, describing the mind-set of his 6-1 Jets. ''You're with one of those teams that has the best record. Now what do you do? Play, you've got to win. You've got to keep winning, because you know something's going to happen. If you keep winning, something good will happen for you.'' Edwards hopes to build off the many good things that happened for the Jets in their overpowering victory over the Dolphins. The Jets gained 472 net yards of offense, their highest total of the season, while holding Miami to 259 yards, the second fewest they have surrendered. The defense forced three turnovers; Chad Pennington threw three touchdown passes. And both Curtis Martin and LaMont Jordan gained more than 100 yards rushing. ''It was an overall good win for us,'' Edwards said. ''We functioned well as an offense, defense, special teams. That's the first time all three phases really clicked in for us.'' Against Miami, the Jets had their most well-rounded outing against a division rival and a defense that, entering the game, was ranked fifth in the N.F.L. What made the victory all the more satisfying to Edwards was that it came after last week's mistake-filled, 13-7 loss to New England, and it allowed the Jets to keep pace with the Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers, who are also 6-1 in the A.F.C. The Jets scored on six straight possessions and thoroughly outplayed an opponent after winning five games by a margin of 8 points or fewer. The Jets faced a moribund opponent but seemed to view it as a breakout game because they handled the 1-7 Dolphins exactly as a top-tier team should have. ''I think people that hadn't watched us a whole lot probably think, 'These guys are pretty good,''' Edwards said. ''But I think for us as a football team, we knew all along, we won some games, but we never really kind of played all together, just going. That came out last night. Now, the whole key is to continue to do that.'' The Jets will try to do so on Sunday at Buffalo against a 2-5 Bills team that bears more than a little resemblance to the Dolphins with a mostly punchless offense (ranked sixth worst in the N.F.L.) and a stout defense (ranked second in the league). To beat the Bills, the Jets might borrow from the formula they used Monday night. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of their showing against the Dolphins was how thoroughly the Jets dominated the line of scrimmage on both offense and defense. Led by center Kevin Mawae, the offensive line manhandled the Dolphins' defensive front, clearing wide running lanes for Martin and Jordan, who might have typified the concept of a balanced running game. Each gained 115 yards (Martin on 19 carries, Jordan on 14) and scored on 25-yard runs. The Jets were so dominant on the line that they were able to run the ball more than twice as much as they threw it and rushed for 275 yards, the most by any team in a game this season. Edwards said that the entire line -- left tackle Jason Fabini, left guard Pete Kendall, Mawae, right guard Jonathan Goodwin and right tackle Kareem McKenzie -- deserved game balls for their efforts. On defense, the Jets' front four bullied the Dolphins' offensive line for much of the night and frequently hurried quarterback Jay Fiedler, flushing him from the pocket and forcing him to rush his throws. ''Our guys, they were rolling last night,'' Edwards said of the defensive line. ''I think our speed showed up a bunch last night on defense, which was good to see.'' None seemed faster than defensive end John Abraham, who finished with three tackles and an impressive first-quarter sack in which he sprinted from his position on the right side, curled around Miami's blockers and chased down Fiedler, who was rolling out some 25 yards across the field. ''That was a big-time play,'' Edwards said of Abraham, who leads the N.F.L. in sacks with eight and a half. ''He chased him a long way and got him.'' Five other members of the Jets' front seven recorded at least half a sack Monday. On a play that might have exemplified Fiedler's night, linebacker Jonathan Vilma, who led the Jets with 9 tackles, and defensive tackle Jason Ferguson, who finished with 4 tackles and 1 1/2 sacks, knifed through the Dolphins' line in the third quarter to share a sack that resulted in a 14-yard loss. In all, Fiedler was sacked four times. ''He was under duress,'' Edwards said, referring to Fiedler but likely hoping he will be able to say the same about more of the Jets' opponents.

The ruling is the second setback in two months for the I.R.S. in its fight against what it regards as questionable tax shelters. Coltec is an industrial concern formerly involved in mining. Last month, a federal judge ruled that the agency owed the Black & Decker Corporation a tax refund of more than $57 million stemming from a transaction that the agency deemed to be abusive, or not valid for tax deductions. The I.R.S. can appeal both the Coltec and Black & Decker decisions. In an opinion dated last Friday, the judge, Susan G. Braden of the United States Court of Federal Claims in Washington, wrote that Coltec had not engaged in an abusive tax shelter but rather in a legitimate business activity when it set up an entity to handle asbestos-related claims. The transaction, known as a contingent liability deal, generated a large tax benefit for Coltec for the 1996 tax year, and in 2000 Coltec filed a refund claim for more than $82 million in federal income taxes that it paid for that year. The I.R.S., calling the transaction a sham with no purpose other than tax avoidance, rejected the claim, and Coltec sued in federal tax court. A trial was held last May. The chief counsel for the I.R.S., Donald Korb, said late yesterday, ''Although we are disappointed by the opinion issued in this case, the service stands by its position on the contingent liability shelter.'' Judge Braden wrote in her ruling that the constitutional separation of powers means that Congress, not the courts, should be used ''to determine how federal tax laws are used to promote economic welfare.'' ''Accordingly,'' her ruling said, ''the court has determined that where a taxpayer has satisfied all statutory requirements established by Congress, as Coltec did in this case, the use of the 'economic substance' doctrine to trump 'mere compliance with the code' would violate the separation of powers.''", "title": "I.R.S.

The data, from the Internal Revenue Service, provide the first glimpse of how the reductions in the estate tax championed by President Bush, which took effect in 2002, have reduced the taxes on the wealthy. The estate tax now applies only to estates greater than $1 million, up from $675,000 when Mr. Bush took office. Those figures double for married couples. The estate tax applies to all assets -- after deducting debts and expenses like funerals and legal fees -- in excess of $1 million a person. Mr. Bush and others, who call this tax the ''death tax,'' assert that it represents second, third or even fourth taxation of the same dollar. In most estates, however, some or all of the dollars have never been taxed because the person held unrealized capital gains or the wealth grew from a tax-free gift. The number of moderately rich estates-- those with taxable fortunes at death of $1 million to $2.5 million -- fell to 21,635 in 2003 from 24,591 in 2001, a decline of 12 percent, the I.R.S. report showed. The value of publicly traded stocks held by these individuals declined 34 percent, to $7.2 billion in 2003 from $10.8 billion in 2001. The figures suggest that the drop in stock prices pushed the wealth of many people below the threshold for the estate tax, explaining why fewer people were in this category. Despite the decline in the value of stocks since 2000, the average wealth of those in this category rose $92,000, or almost 6 percent, to just under $1.6 million, as the value of homes and other real estate rose sharply and the value of bonds grew. This partly reflected falling interest rates, which make real estate and bonds paying higher than current interest rates more valuable. Over the same period, the number of taxable estates valued at $20 million or more, the highest category in I.R.S. reports, increased nearly 8 percent, to 505 from 469. More significant, the average value of these estates grew to $62 million, a 10 percent increase from 2001, when their average value was $56.4 million. The values reported on estate tax returns can be based on the date of death or six months after death if the value of the assets has declined. Estate tax returns are typically filed nine months after death. Thus the figures on wealth holding tend to reflect conditions stretching over parts of two years. The estate tax produced 9.5 percent less revenue for the federal government in 2003 from estates of $1 million or more than in 2001, despite a 1.4 percent increase in total value of such estates, the data show. Total estate tax revenue fell to just under $20.7 billion, a decline of more than 12 percent from 2001, because the threshold was raised to $1 million. Taxes from estates valued at less than $1 million were zero in 2003; the 2001 figure was almost $711 million. Over all, the share of estates paid in estate taxes fell slightly, to 18.8 percent from 19 percent. Among estates valued at $1 million to $2.5 million, the moderately rich, the average tax rate fell to 11.2 percent from 15.2 percent, reducing the effective tax rate more than a fourth. For the superrich, those leaving estates of $20 million or more, the average tax rate fell to 16.5 percent from 18.4 percent.

''And I think his presence changed the attitude of this organization and the position of this organization. So for management and ownership to make the decisions that they made with personnel, it's kind of disheartening, to tell you the truth, for a guy like Jason Kidd. I mean, hey, his efforts, to tell you the truth, were just pushed to the side. Now, I mean you've got an upset captain who, to tell you the truth, probably wants to be moved.'' The Nets let Kenyon Martin, Kerry Kittles, Rodney Rogers and Lucious Harris depart after three straight Atlantic Division titles. Kidd, who had off-season knee surgery, will start the season on the injured list and will most likely miss at least the first month of the season. ''That kind of makes me concerned about the future of this team and what direction we're going to go in, regardless of what type of efforts we put out on the court and the preparation,'' said Mourning, who signed a four-year deal with the Nets in 2003. ''And that's my main concern right there, because one of my main reasons for playing here was to play with Jason Kidd. Now you've got a guy that's upset and has mixed feelings about coming back to play because of the changes that were made. Obviously, I'm a veteran in this league and I've got a small window of opportunity to play this game. So I want to be in the best possible situation that's going to help benefit me at the same time.'' Mourning, whose steady progress was a pleasant surprise, is one of the Nets' few bright spots. He played in only 12 regular-season games the past two seasons, but he measures success not in points or rebounds, but in trying to top the record for survival after a kidney transplant, 39 years. ''I've said plenty of times before that I was upset with the changes that were made here because a year or so ago, when I made the decision to play here, I wasn't expecting these types of changes,'' Mourning said. ''With that said, I'm still under contract, and I will fulfill those contractual duties. So I come out here, I'm professional about all of this.'' Mourning can make no guarantees about what he can contribute after playing only one preseason game, in which he had 12 points, 5 rebounds and 2 blocks in 19 minutes last Thursday. He has rapidly accelerated his workouts and was one of the last players on the court again on Tuesday. ''I don't have a crystal ball,'' he said. ''I'm going to do what I can to try and get back to the old Alonzo Mourning form. I think I have to take baby steps through all this.'' He added: ''Can I contribute to this team? Yes, I think so. As long as I'm healthy and I'm out there on this floor, I feel I'm going to continue to get better. The only thing that will stop me is an injury or possibly rejection and the doctors tell me that I have to stop playing.''

While there are a million different ways to look at the 2004 campaign, those of us at The Hotline thought it might be a good idea to follow the numbers. Billions of dollars were spent in this year's race, on advertising, polls, mailings and campaign stops. To put Campaign 2004 in the appropriate perspective, we tallied the figures and crunched the spending in the battleground states and beyond. Here's a portrait of politics as it is today -- or at least as it was yesterday. More states formed the battleground for this presidential race than in any election since 1992, with more than half (26) at one point identified as target states, defined by ad buys on local television stations. The money race was fueled by changes in the campaign financing law that allowed individuals to contribute as much as $2,000 per candidate, up from $1,000. And it helped make one sector of the media very rich -- local TV stations. According to TNSMI/CMAG, which tracks television ad spending, from March 3 to Oct. 28, about $575 million was spent on presidential TV ads. That's the equivalent of more than $2 million spent for each of the 270 electoral votes needed to win. While the increases in individual contributions were supposed to help President Bush, Senator John Kerry and his Democratic allies outspent the president and his Republican allies in each of the five big battleground states (Florida, Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin). These five states accounted for more than half of the money spent by both parties and their allies for TV ad time (about $380 million of the $575 million spent). Beginning in March, the big battleground television spending broke down this way: Florida, $2.6 million on each of its 27 electoral votes by Mr. Kerry and his allies; $1.7 million per electoral vote by Mr. Bush and the Republicans. In Ohio, Democrats spent nearly $3.4 million per electoral vote to try to win the state's 20 votes, compared with $1.8 million for the Republicans. In Pennsylvania, the spending for each of its 21 electoral votes again favored the Democrats, $2.2 million to $1.4 million. In Iowa, Democrats spent $1.6 million for each of 7 votes compared with the Republicans' $1.2 million. And in Wisconsin, Democrats spent just under $2 million versus the Republicans' $1.3 million for each of its 10 electoral votes. Aside from television stations, others benefited from the campaign money. After the consulting business, the biggest moneymaker is the United States Postal Service, which charges 11 cents for each piece of political direct mail. Consultants have calculated that at least 15 million pieces of direct mail were sent in each of the big five battleground states, for presidential-campaign postage revenue of more than $8 million. Polling operations were as outsized as many other parts of the campaign apparatus, with more polls in more states than in any previous election. Nearly 1 percent of registered voters in Florida and Ohio participated in a public opinion poll. In total, 50,819 people were surveyed in Florida in public polls released from March 3 until Election Day. In Ohio, those surveyed reached 37,871. And thanks to their status as both key primary states and key battleground states, more than 8 percent of registered voters in Iowa and New Hampshire participated in a poll from Jan. 1, 2003 until Election Day. But a true campaign still wouldn't be real without a few retail stops, and the battleground states found themselves deluged by the repeated visits of the candidates and their surrogates. For much of the year, some critical states shed their flyover-state obscurity. Since March, Mr. Bush visited six states more than 10 times: Pennsylvania (23), Ohio (20), Florida (19), Wisconsin (14), Iowa (13) and Michigan (11). During the same period, Mr. Kerry visited seven states more than 10 times: Ohio (29), Pennsylvania (24), Florida (23), Wisconsin (17), California (12), Iowa (11) and Missouri (10). Ohio became the most popular destination for the presidential running mates by August, with Vice President Dick Cheney visiting 13 times and Senator John Edwards dropping by 17 times. Laura Bush also became smitten with the Buckeye State, stumping there 12 times during that time frame. Not surprisingly, Teresa Heinz Kerry went most often to her home state, Pennsylvania. Only one state has been neglected by both presidential candidates: Vermont. In total, Mr. Bush stepped foot in 48 states between his inauguration and Election Day, with Rhode Island being the only other state he has yet to visit. Mr. Kerry visited 46 states, also skipping Hawaii, Montana and Nebraska. Other notable statistics include the number of times certain phrases were mentioned. In the first seven months of the year, ''Swift boat veterans'' surfaced 136 times in the LexisNexis database, which catalogs daily newspaper and magazine articles as well as television news transcripts. But in August, the database listed 2,814 references for the term, an average of nearly 100 media references a day that month. Races for the House and Senate did not suffer for a lack of statistical anomalies this year as well. Bill Jones, the Republican Senate nominee in California, is the first major party candidate in nearly 30 years for that seat not to run a single TV ad. About 15 percent of the House of Representatives ran unopposed this year: 63 House members faced no major party opposition, and three Republican nominees in Texas and Georgia did not face official major party opposition. Of the other 369 House races, 45 were rematches. Three candidates (Cynthia McKinney, Democrat of Georgia; Dan Lungren, Republican of California, and Bob Inglis, Republican of South Carolina) were former members making a comeback for their old job (and old seniority). In the Senate, which is largely white and largely male, two races -- in Florida and in Illinois -- featured candidates on both sides who are not white men. In one of the hardest-fought Senate races, it appeared that Tom Daschle of South Dakota set a record for the most TV ads broadcast for a statewide race in the nation's history. He began his TV ad war in July 2003 and essentially never went off the air. Within these deeply divided states, there could be as many as a dozen Democratic senators representing states carried by Mr. Bush this year by five percentage points or more, while there is just one Republican senator from a state won by Mr. Kerry by five points or more. The re-redistricting of Texas Congressional districts moved the state from a Democrat-controlled delegation to a Republican-controlled delegation (a distinction that matters only in Electoral College ties and challenges). From high voter registration figures, to extraordinary spending, to marathon campaign fly-arounds, interest in this year's election has certainly seemed intense. The news media also bought into the enthusiasm, with many outlets significantly expanding their coverage. C-Span recorded 4,050 calls into its morning ''Washington Journal'' program from Labor Day until last Friday. It devoted more than 1,000 hours to campaign coverage, including 101 debates between candidates for Senate, House and governor. The cable network's first televised Democratic presidential primary event was a January 2003 fund-raising dinner featuring Dick Gephardt, John Kerry and Howard Dean. The three major newsweeklies (Time, Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report) didn't disappoint, devoting 36 covers since Jan. 1, 2003, to a presidential candidate. Mr. Kerry was pictured, at least partly, on 19 of those 36 covers. Mr. Bush was pictured, at least partially, on 20 of those 36 covers. Mr. Dean was pictured, at least partly, on 7 of those 36 covers, six of which were before Feb. 1 of this year. Any index of the season would not be complete without the contributions of the late night comedians. While trying to score the number of jokes about both major candidates, we leave you with a joke from Jay Leno on Dec. 8, 2002, a day that was frigid on the East Coast: ''In fact, in Massachusetts, the winds were so strong yesterday that John Kerry's hair actually moved.'' Mr. Leno, though, had to explain to his audience: ''You see, he's running for president. I wanted to get the first joke in.'' Now that Campaign 2004 is out of the way, don't think a few presidential wannabes haven't already noticed that there are 1,461 days until Election Day 2008. Howard Dean and Hillary Clinton campaigned for or raised money for more than 30 House, Senate or governor candidates. Wesley Clark campaigned for at least 20 House or Senate candidates. Rudy Giuliani stumped for nearly a dozen candidates around the country. John McCain's stump total was close to 20. Gov. George Pataki of New York distinguished himself in this category by stumping for more gubernatorial candidates than any other future presidential candidate in the country.

I'm writing this on tenterhooks on Tuesday, without knowing the election results. But whether John Kerry's supporters are now celebrating or seeking asylum abroad, they should be feeling wretched about the millions of farmers, factory workers and waitresses who ended up voting -- utterly against their own interests -- for Republican candidates. One of the Republican Party's major successes over the last few decades has been to persuade many of the working poor to vote for tax breaks for billionaires. Democrats are still effective on bread-and-butter issues like health care, but they come across in much of America as arrogant and out of touch the moment the discussion shifts to values. ''On values, they are really noncompetitive in the heartland,'' noted Mike Johanns, a Republican who is governor of Nebraska. ''This kind of elitist, Eastern approach to the party is just devastating in the Midwest and Western states. It's very difficult for senatorial, Congressional and even local candidates to survive.'' In the summer, I was home -- too briefly -- in Yamhill, Ore., a rural, working-class area where most people would benefit from Democratic policies on taxes and health care. But many of those people disdain Democrats as elitists who empathize with spotted owls rather than loggers. One problem is the yuppification of the Democratic Party. Thomas Frank, author of the best political book of the year, ''What's the Matter With Kansas: How Conservatives Won the Heart of America,'' says that Democratic leaders have been so eager to win over suburban professionals that they have lost touch with blue-collar America. ''There is a very upper-middle-class flavor to liberalism, and that's just bound to rub average people the wrong way,'' Mr. Frank said. He notes that Republicans have used ''culturally powerful but content-free issues'' to connect to ordinary voters. To put it another way, Democrats peddle issues, and Republicans sell values. Consider the four G's: God, guns, gays and grizzlies. One-third of Americans are evangelical Christians, and many of them perceive Democrats as often contemptuous of their faith. And, frankly, they're often right. Some evangelicals take revenge by smiting Democratic candidates. Then we have guns, which are such an emotive issue that Idaho's Democratic candidate for the Senate two years ago, Alan Blinken, felt obliged to declare that he owned 24 guns ''and I use them all.'' He still lost. As for gays, that's a rare wedge issue that Democrats have managed to neutralize in part, along with abortion. Most Americans disapprove of gay marriage but do support some kind of civil unions (just as they oppose ''partial birth'' abortions but don't want teenage girls to die from coat-hanger abortions). Finally, grizzlies -- a metaphor for the way environmentalism is often perceived in the West as high-handed. When I visited Idaho, people were still enraged over a Clinton proposal to introduce 25 grizzly bears into the wild. It wasn't worth antagonizing most of Idaho over 25 bears. ''The Republicans are smarter,'' mused Oregon's governor, Ted Kulongoski, a Democrat. ''They've created ... these social issues to get the public to stop looking at what's happening to them economically.'' ''What we once thought -- that people would vote in their economic self-interest -- is not true, and we Democrats haven't figured out how to deal with that.'' Bill Clinton intuitively understood the challenge, and John Edwards seems to as well, perhaps because of their own working-class origins. But the party as a whole is mostly in denial. To appeal to middle America, Democratic leaders don't need to carry guns to church services and shoot grizzlies on the way. But a starting point would be to shed their inhibitions about talking about faith, and to work more with religious groups. Otherwise, the Democratic Party's efforts to improve the lives of working-class Americans in the long run will be blocked by the very people the Democrats aim to help. William Safire appears on Thursday.

Coach Jack Del Rio said the Jaguars' bye week might provide Leftwich with enough rest, The Associated Press reported last night. ''We'll re-evaluate Monday and have a better sense of when Byron will be able to join us,'' he said. ''We have not ruled out the Detroit Lions here at home.'' The Jaguars said that Leftwich was examined yesterday by Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham, Ala., and that he would not need surgery. The diagnosis was a sprained lateral collateral ligament and rest was prescribed, Del Rio said. The Jaguars resume play Nov. 14 against Detroit. If Leftwich cannot start, the backup David Garrard will replace him. Garrard, a fourth-round pick in 2002, has played in just one game this season, coming in for two plays after Leftwich left the game just before halftime. Garrard completed both of his pass attempts, for 28 yards. In three seasons, he has played in seven games and completed 34 of 60 passes. Leftwich was injured about 90 seconds before halftime when he was hit by two Texans, but he put himself back into the game less than a minute later, without consulting with coaches, Coach Jack Del Rio said Monday. Leftwich finished the game, going 25 of 40 for 227 yards with 2 interceptions. Leftwich experienced swelling in the knee, and on Monday, he had a magnetic resonance imaging test in Jacksonville. He then went to Alabama to see Andrews, a renowned orthopedic surgeon. Leftwich's superb play has helped the Jaguars to a surprising 5-3 start and first place in the American Football Conference South.

The next morning, as the only female entrant, she ran 15 miles and dropped out because of a nagging illness. ''Had I known that it was going to be such a growing event, I would have gone back and finished,'' she said recently. Kuscsik's presence in a race confined to friends in Central Park did not have the dramatic impact of Kathrine Switzer's nearly having her number torn off by a race official in the 1967 Boston Marathon. But Kuscsik lit the fuse of the women's running explosion in New York. A third of the 36,000 runners in Sunday's 35th edition are women -- a number skewed downward by the number of international entrants, the race director Allan Steinfeld said. Between 1979 and 1999, the percentage of female finishers in the race ticked up between 1 and 3 percent each year with a few plateaus. It reached a high of 34 percent in 2003 with 11,715 women. Steinfeld said he did not expect the expanding presence of women to hit the proverbial wall anytime soon. ''It was like the Dutch boy holding the finger in the dike,'' said Kathleen Gerson, a sociology professor at New York University. ''It was bound to happen. This was a force that was bound to overwhelm whatever obstacles were in its way.'' New York City seemed ripe to push the progress of women in sports. Just as Title IX, the 1972 gender-rights legislation, began to level the playing field for women athletes around the country, one of the marathon's co-founders, Fred Lebow, along with Kuscsik and Switzer, initiated an all-women's race called the Mini. New York was also at the crest of the fitness wave. Aerobics dance classes developed by a runner named Jackie Sorenson became popular in Manhattan, and the influx of women in the gym began to spill over into jogging and racing, Kuscsik said. The changes afoot did not quell the activist in Kuscsik, however. Before the 1972 New York City Marathon, Kuscsik and the other female competitors felt patronized and segregated because they were given a 10-minute head start. They staged a sit-down strike before the race, circulating a petition that was signed by every male participant, and after that the marathon eliminated the separate starts. On Sunday, the elite women will be given a 35-minute jump to ensure that they have the stage to themselves. The marathon started to become a populist celebration when the course spread through all five boroughs in 1976, and it attracted more and more rank-and-file female racers. Increased television coverage provided an additional boost. During the reign of Grete Waitz, who won the race nine times between 1978 and 1989, the number of female finishers jumped from 184 (5 percent) to 4,688 (19 percent). Then a forgotten demographic emerged. After an adulthood spent pushing their daughters, the mothers of the Title IX generation took up running, too, Switzer said. Many set their sights on New York. The average female participant in 2003, according to the New York Road Runners, was 37 years old, had a college degree, worked as a teacher, was single and finished the race in 4 hours 53 minutes. ''You feel heroic,'' Switzer said. ''It's the biggest lure of the marathon. Daily living doesn't necessarily give one the sense of the heroic. That's what New York does.'' Sylvie Darmon, a 49-year-old pediatrician from Nice, France, chose New York for her first marathon over an array of events in Europe. ''Among all the marathons, New York is the mythic one,'' she said. ''If you do only one, it's the one you want to do.'' Darmon might not have heard of Switzer, but every woman in a singlet on Sunday can thank her on some level. Switzer's collision with history in the '67 Boston Marathon inspired more women to sign up, and the marathon responded by lowering its time standards. That forced women to improve, Switzer said, and motivated more of them to run to meet the challenge. Switzer's pioneering steps also made an imprint on the New York City Marathon and Lebow. ''My incident in the Boston Marathon certainly inspired Fred to bring women into his race,'' she said. ''He saw them as a fabulous publicity vehicle. He knew he could get in the newspaper. We women were delighted.'' Steinfeld, the current race director, said an interest in social justice also motivated Lebow. Kuscsik confessed that she was not thinking about the big picture before the first New York City Marathon, but she thinks about it now. Kuscsik, who retired from running after more than 80 marathons, including victories in Boston and New York, plans to be in New York on Sunday to cheer. ''I definitely accelerated something,'' she said.

Rutgers Coach Greg Schiano had already moved on. The Scarlet Knights were preparing for a game Saturday at 24th-ranked Boston College. His frustration bubbled to the surface at a news conference Saturday, after a tough 35-30 loss to West Virginia at Rutgers Stadium. West Virginia was ranked 15th entering the game. ''This could have been a big turnaround game for us,'' Bob Mulcahy, the Rutgers athletic director, said in an interview Tuesday. ''We came back in that game. We feel for these kids.'' Schiano questioned a call that he thought should have been made on an onsides kick by Rutgers with 1 minute 22 seconds remaining, after the Scarlet Knights' second touchdown in four minutes. After a fake, the kick bounced out of bounds, and West Virginia gained possession. But Schiano said the Mountaineers had ventured into the neutral zone. A replay showed that three West Virginia players, not just one or two, were offside. Had there been a call, Rutgers would have been able to kick again. Schiano was so upset after the game that he made a vague suggestion that some people in the ''great state of New Jersey'' were still trying to tear down his program. Asked Tuesday what that meant, Schiano said: ''I'm not going to get into it. But I meant it in all sincerity. When I said 'the great state of New Jersey,' I mean it is great, and it deserves a championship program. And I'm going to give it all I can to get one.'' Rutgers (4-4) must win two of its last three games to finish with a winning record and become eligible for a bowl game for just the second time. Schiano, 38, in his fourth season at Rutgers, has much larger aspirations for the Scarlet Knights, although a bowl would be regarded as a monumental accomplishment. ''I really think we're building a program, and we still have a chance to go 7-4, not just 6-5 or 5-6,'' he said as he headed back to his office after his weekly news conference. Then, referring to a winning season, he said, ''If it didn't occur, I wouldn't think it's the end of the world.'' A report Saturday in The Record of Hackensack quoted several of the state's top high school prospects saying that Rutgers had lost its recruiting edge in New Jersey. A week after opening this season by upsetting Michigan State, Rutgers lost to New Hampshire, a Division I-AA program. Those prospects said they began looking elsewhere. In the week leading to the West Virginia game, Mulcahy had been a guest on the student radio station and argued with a caller who criticized Schiano. Mulcahy, who said reports of the exchange were ''totally taken out of context,'' said he told the caller he was not qualified to say that Schiano had been outcoached. Mulcahy also said on the radio show that students who booed the team should be more supportive. ''These are college kids,'' Mulcahy said Tuesday. ''They've got to give them a chance.'' The defiance that Schiano and Mulcahy showed apparently never drifted to the team. Schiano told his team after the game that he was proud of the way they played. ''It was very positive,'' quarterback Ryan Hart said when asked to characterize Schiano's postgame comments. ''Just move it along.'' The next opponent looks just as imposing. Rutgers has not beaten Boston College since 1991. ''I'm sure a bowl game is a goal for every program, but we talk about the process,'' defensive back Derrick Roberson said. ''You can't go straight to a bowl. That's why we're focusing on just this week, and Boston College.'' But recruiting is an issue again. The Eagles' roster includes a dozen players from New Jersey. Schiano said B.C. had strong ties to the state's Catholic high schools. ''There's a natural connection,'' he said. But at least Rutgers has a chance for the second straight season to finish over .500, Schiano said. Last year's team was 4-4 before it lost three of its last four games. ''People need to remember that in November, for years, this program didn't have a chance to finish with a winning record,'' Schiano said. ''It's a process. We've gone from lousy to competitive. Let's see where that process continues.''

Although the problems did not lead to widespread disorder, they left New Yorkers, including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, frustrated that election officials did not seem to have addressed longstanding complaints about the outdated voting system. ''At this stage in our electoral process -- what is it, over 200 years? -- we should have more advanced technology to vote,'' said David Bartolomi, 39, a Manhattan photographer waiting at an East 49th Street polling place where machines broke down. ''This is the first time in 12 years I've had to wait on line to vote.'' Three of the eight machines at a polling site in the Murray Hill section of Manhattan broke down early in the morning, forcing voters to use paper ballots. At a busy Wall Street polling site, workers showed up an hour after the polls opened and did not know how to use the equipment, spawning long waits by frustrated voters. Residents of Park Slope, Brooklyn, also complained of lengthy delays and confusing instructions from poll workers, who sent one woman to the wrong school to vote. Workers at a Greenwich Village polling place could not find the registrars' books needed to check off the names of voters. After casting his vote at a school on East 81st Street yesterday morning, Mr. Bloomberg echoed voters' complaints and criticized the city's Board of Elections, whose phone lines and Web site were jammed or inoperable for long periods, thwarting voters trying to locate polling sites. ''We had offered them some help, but they wanted to preserve their independence from the administration, and so they declined the help,'' Mr. Bloomberg said of the board. ''But they better get their act together by next year.'' ''This has been an antiquated system for an awful long time,'' he said, ''and we've not been able to improve it, I think, in any meaningful sense.'' John Ravitz, executive director of the elections board, said that problems with voting equipment were not widespread, adding that the board had not turned down help. Noting that the board operates more than 7,000 voting machines, Mr. Ravitz said, ''These machines are from the 1960's and are doing a good job.'' Board officials said that their telephone lines were deluged with up to 1,000 calls an hour yesterday, overloading the system, but that a bare-bones version of their Web site, which was down most of Monday, was running yesterday. They said they were caught off guard by the long wait times some voters experienced at the polls. ''We didn't expect there would be two-hour lines, but we expected it would take some time,'' said Chris Riley, a spokesman for the board. ''Usually during an election, you'll hit a dip 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. This election, we haven't seen that dip.'' The board bought 400 used voting machines in preparation for what was expected to be a large turnout. More than 400,000 new voter registrations in the past year increased the number of registered voters to 4.4 million. New York was one of 24 states to get waivers allowing them to delay complying with federal requirements -- put into place after the 2000 election -- to replace mechanical voting equipment with new technology. Complaints of problems at the polls extended beyond New York City. In Westchester, where State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Republican, faced a hard-fought race, Democrats won a court order impounding the ballots after several voters complained of irregularities. One voter said in an affidavit that that he arrived at the polls to find that someone else had signed next to his name. And two people said in affidavits that voting machines registered two votes cast before the polls opened at 6 a.m. In New Jersey, more than 300 people went to the Constitutional Litigation Clinic at the Rutgers School of Law in Newark to complain that they had not been allowed to vote by machine or by provisional ballot, an alternative form of voting for those not properly registered. ''These are people that say they haven't done anything like move or change their addresses,'' said Penny Venetis, a law professor, who said she had not seen so many aggrieved voters in her 11 years at the center. ''They were just told that they could not vote, period.'' In Connecticut, where about 275,000 new voters registered for the election, people waited for as long as two hours at some polling places. Election officials in Hartford reported heavy turnout statewide, and in some towns, registrars seemed unprepared for the volume. Voters at an elementary school in Darien waited up to an hour, only to find a lone, elderly registrar slowly checking off names as people filed into the gymnasium. But the worst scenes of confusion were at polling places around New York. At 45 Wall Street, a luxury apartment building that serves as a polling place for most Wall Street residents, poll workers were unfamiliar with their tasks, and one of the two machines broke down. As replacement workers from the elections board scrambled to try to restore order -- placing a cardboard box marked ''official ballot box'' on a folding table -- a line of voters stretched out the door, nearly to the statue of George Washington in front of Federal Hall National Memorial a block away. ''They sent five people who hadn't been through training,'' said Louise Burley, an inspector from the elections board. ''You're supposed to have some kind of training. I don't understand.'' At Liberty High School on West 128th Street, voters whose last names began with the letters A through L became angry because the wait in their line was two hours, while the M-Z line was nearly empty. After repeated complaints, the poll worker on the A-L line was replaced. For the most part, New Yorkers seemed to take the long wait in stride. In the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan, voters spent more than an hour in long lines at Public School 51 on West 45th Street, reading books or talking. ''I've never seen anything like this,'' said Vera Wells, who said she had been voting in the neighborhood since the early 1980's. ''It's chaotic, but it's civilized chaos.''

Security authorities said emergency personnel were on standby alert, but there were no reports of any incidents. In the capital, officials at the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency were stationed at their emergency command posts, but even there officials reported little activity beyond routine reports from their field units, which indicated no sign of terror activity. The relative tranquillity of Election Day contrasted with the high anxiety of the preceding months when counterterrorism officials had repeatedly warned of a potentially catastrophic attack by Al Qaeda inside the United States timed to disrupt the electoral process. In recent days, these officials said they had uncovered no evidence of such an operation, after thousands of interviews in the United States and a global effort to track down anti-American extremists. In May, July and August, senior law enforcement and intelligence authorities made urgent public announcements about the terror threat warning that Al Qaeda was almost ready to strike. At the same time, they issued dozens of bulletins to state and local officials advising them to be increasingly vigilant. Some officials said they suspected that an attack of some kind might still be coming. They said the period of concern should be extended from the election through the presidential inauguration in January. But over all, it seemed apparent from interviews among counterterrorism officials on Tuesday that the mood of feverish concern had ebbed as the election appeared to have taken place without incident. Some hinted that the government might soon downshift its terror warnings. ''Following the election, we will assess the threat environment and the alert status to determine what security posture we will need to have in place based on intelligence assessments,'' said Brian Roehrkasse, the spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security. At the Justice Department, Mark Corallo, the spokesman, said: ''We're still working overtime. The F.B.I. and all of our partners at the state and local level are pounding the pavement, pressing sources for information, staying on top of it. We're doing everything we can to detect and disrupt the terrorist threat. And if nothing happens, we're going to be out there tomorrow doing the same thing.'' Officials said that absence of any tangible sign of an attack had led them to a fresh assessment of the possible significance of a recent videotape by Osama bin Laden, which was first broadcast Friday by the Arab-language satellite network Al Jazeera and transmitted by television outlets around the world. On the videotape, Mr. bin Laden directly addressed Americans in an unusually formal statement in which he said: ''Your security is not the hands of Kerry or Bush or Al Qaeda. Your security is in your own hands.'' It was possible, the officials theorized, that Mr. bin Laden, while he remained a worrisome threat, lacked the resources and personnel to direct an attack in the United States. Instead, they said, he may have decided to resort to a statement in an effort to disrupt the election. Within counterterrorism circles in the government, officials are still debating why they have found so little evidence of an election-year attack, a concern that seemed credible enough to impose extraordinary security measures at the two national political conventions in Boston and New York and other government events, like the Group of 8 economic summit in Georgia this past summer. Some counterterrorism officials said they doubted that there was ever a solid basis for believing that Al Qaeda would strike in the United States this year, although others disputed that assessment and said the intelligence about an attack was specific and persuasive. Some officials suggested that intensive disruption and detection efforts might have caused Al Qaeda to postpone or cancel its plans, which could still be activated any time the terror network gauged that it had a good chance of successfully carrying them out. The most significant threat discovered by the authorities this year, a Qaeda surveillance operation directed at five American financial institutions, has led the authorities to what they now say is a dead end. The detailed reconnaissance plans alarmed the authorities and caused them to elevate the alert level in New York, Newark and Washington. The investigation led to a group of eight Qaeda suspects in Britain, including a man who officials said actually carried out the surveillance operation. But the investigation yielded no evidence that the group had been planning to attack the financial institutions or any other targets in the United States, as was initially suspected.

To me, the review's reporters embodied what journalism was about. There was Bertil Lintner, the Swedish buccaneer who spent a year walking along the Chinese-Burma border during the 1980's with his wife. Their baby was born along the way, and Mr. Lintner continued to file mammoth articles that gave voice to a culture nobody would pay anyone to cover. There was John MacBeth, the New Zealander who kept reporting from East Timor to Jakarta even after his leg was amputated, battling the Indonesian strongman Suharto. There was Nayan Chanda, the Bengali from Calcutta, among the last reporters left in Saigon when North Vietnamese tanks invaded the city. Mr. Chanda was filing his article as Communist tanks were crashing through the city gates. He kept working until two Communists walked up to him and literally pulled the plug of the telex machine. And then there was Nate Thayer. My hero. During the 1980's and 90's, the mercurial Mr. Thayer hung out with the Cambodian resistance, dodging Khmer bullets in the jungles around Angkor Wat, fleeing Vietnamese troops across the Thai border and even at one point inadvertently running over a land mine, which exploded and destroyed his pickup truck. In 1997, he finally got the reward he had been seeking: Khmer commanders took him deep into the jungle, where he found Pol Pot. Last week, Dow Jones, publisher of The Far Eastern Economic Review, announced it was shutting it down and laying off 80 people. The current Nov. 4 issue will be the last of its kind; while Dow Jones is keeping the brand name alive, FEER will be a monthly with essays from academics and government officials: not a Nate Thayer in the bunch. Four years ago, on my way home from Beijing, I met the FEER reporter Murray Hiebert on the plane. He was fresh out of a Kuala Lumpur prison, where he had just spent a month for reporting about a Malaysian judge's wife who had sued an international school for kicking her son off the debate team. I was star-struck; here was one of my heroes in the flesh, still battle-scarred. Murray was bashful. ''I think most journalists should go to jail for a month,'' he said later.

And US Airways employees, who have seen their pay cut by more than 20 percent and their health insurance and pension plans shrink, are certainly an unhappy lot. ''People are still giving 110 percent, but they are being totally beaten down,'' said Francis I. Smith, 53, a 24-year employee who handles spare-parts inventories in Pittsburgh. Even if they were slouching on the job, would it matter? These days, passengers are more likely to comb the Internet for cheap, convenient flights than to patronize a favorite airline. Thus, if smiling employees and squeaky-clean planes no longer woo repeat business, would scowling employees and dirty planes drive it away? ''I'm not sure that employee morale is so important anymore,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management. ''Air travel has become a commodity, and passengers make their decisions on who's got the cheapest fare, not on whose employees are the friendliest.'' Still, management experts say the miasma of gloom will probably take a toll, not just at US Airways, but at Delta, United and at most other airlines. ''Passengers can sense the attitudes, the emotion, the stress, and it carries over to their tangible impression of the company,'' said John D. Kasarda, a professor of management who specializes in airlines at the Kenan-Flagler Business School of the University of North Carolina. The biggest question for US Airways is whether it can survive the bad morale before the bad morale helps do it in. Company executives say they are taking steps that will improve working conditions and profitability. For now, the airline seems to be hanging on. On a recent Monday afternoon, for example, Barry S. Levy flew the US Airways shuttle from Boston to La Guardia. The flight, he said, was remarkable for its unremarkability. It took off on time, flight attendants were pleasant, and customer service representatives in New York helped him book a contingency return flight on Delta, in case he missed the last shuttle home. ''Everyone was professional, everyone was courteous,'' Dr. Levy said. ''You would never have known the airline was in bankruptcy.'' Indeed, US Airways employees seem almost proud that they are keeping their personal woes from the outside world. Dianne Fogarty, a US Airways flight attendant with 33 years of service, has lost pay and vacation days and said she was resentful that, in her view, management sees her as only ''a dollar sign.'' Nonetheless, she said, ''they will not take my work ethic, my sense of humor or my smile.'' While service may not be slipping, worker productivity may be a thornier issue. It is difficult to quantify -- flight times and schedules are out of employee control, as are delays at congested airports. Still, there is anecdotal evidence that some pilots have slowed their planes and that some employees have been calling in sick more often, either out of anger or a practical desire to use up sick days before they lose them. Moreover, pilots, flight attendants and tarmac workers express a mounting anger at a management they say blames employees for the company's woes at the same time that it hampers their productivity by scheduling flights that keep them waiting for hours, often without pay. Some contend that the airline left the field open to low-cost competitors when it eliminated direct flights from La Guardia to Florida in 2002 -- flights the airline may reinstate. Kevin Cogley, a maintenance mechanic in Pittsburgh with 15 years service, argued that programs US Airways has installed to reorder parts automatically, keep track of employee time and outsource maintenance have all served to reduce efficiency, not enhance it. ''The hourly employees have told management for years that there was waste, but management has always taken the attitude that 'father knows best,''' he said. US Airways officers vigorously dispute that. Christopher L. Chiames, senior vice president for corporate affairs, said management had used employee meetings, newsletters, Web casts and intranet chats to keep employees informed and to solicit suggestions. ''I go out in the field, and I hear employees saying, The company never tells us anything,'' Mr. Chiames said. ''Well, we try, in every way, to explain that we're not just looking to employee pay cuts as the answer.'' Still, airline experts say employee complaints are not totally unfounded. Many note that even though labor costs at Southwest Airlines are a high percentage of operating costs, the airline is solidly profitable. These experts say that Southwest employees are generally younger, less demanding on compensation or on the privileges of seniority, and most important, more willing to accept management work rules, largely because they do not feel that management is clamping down on employee freedom to cover up its own incompetence or on compensation to pad its own pockets. ''Southwest treats its employees as a source of value, not of cost, so they work to turn planes around faster and are flexible,'' said Jody Hoffer Gittell, an assistant professor of management at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University, who has written extensively about airlines. ''US Airways' biggest mistake is to view employee costs as the reason for its current troubles and the primary method to extricate itself from them.'' With airlines cutting jobs, many US Airways employees say they see few alternatives to picking up the slack for those who have quit or call in sick. For example, US Airways has been shuttling members of a slimmed-down maintenance staff among airports. Employees are angry, but acquiescent. ''It was either take the layoff or go where your seniority will hold,'' said Norbert Schwartzmiller, 31, a maintenance worker from Pittsburgh who is now assigned to the Philadelphia airport. Few employees have the luxury of quitting. Take Mary Blosser, who has spent 19 years as a US Airways flight attendant. Without much technology training, Ms. Blosser said, changing careers is not easy. ''We still enjoy the job,'' she said, ''but everything has made it more difficult.'' For others, the enjoyment is long gone, along with the high pay. ''Management is real bad,'' said Eyob Gebremedhin, 29, a ramp worker at Reagan National Airport with six years of service. ''They don't do nothing.'' Some things, of course, are out of management's control. In addition to soaring fuel costs, US Airways and the other airlines are also facing fare-shopping passengers who fly low-cost start-ups like JetBlue. Moreover, greater congestion at hub airports like O'Hare in Chicago and La Guardia has forced planes to waste fuel in taxiing and circling and has slowed the turnaround of planes. US Airways also has problems beyond those of its rivals. It concentrates on short domestic flights, rather than more profitable international routes. Four years ago, when other airlines were installing electronic passenger counters and other upgraded systems, US Airways was pursuing a merger with United Airlines; when that merger fell apart, US Airways was left with antiquated systems that it never replaced. The airline also gave up some lucrative routes to assure the government that the merger would not reduce competition. In fact, some employees say that their concessions to management have made things worse. Without ''the economic sword of Damocles'' hanging over them, ''management will rise to the lowest level of performance and not schedule efficiently,'' said Eddie Hoffman, 50, a pilot who has worked at US Airways since 1978. He said his time was ''not carefully husbanded but carelessly wasted.'' Mr. Hoffman acknowledges that the airline is trying new strategies, like adding profitable Caribbean routes. But he remains angry. He says his questions for management is, What took you so long? Management experts say US Airways apparently has done a poor job of internal communications. ''It would help if they say, 'Here's what we've done to improve things before cutting pay, do you have ideas for what else we can do?''' said Austan D. Goolsbee, professor of economics at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. US Airways insists it has been doing just that. Mr. Chiames said the airline had reworked its schedules to add 200 daily flights in February without adding more planes and had identified more than $100 million in ticket distribution savings, by replacing travel agents and sales clerks with Web-based ticket sales. He said that US Airways was asking only for things that employees at low-cost rivals provide. ''We'd be crazy not to acknowledge that our employees are frustrated and angry, and that their jobs aren't as glamorous anymore,'' he said. ''But they have to understand, JetBlue hires ticket agents for $9 an hour while many of ours already make $20.05, and Southwest's flight attendants have always cleaned planes between flights.'' In interviews, employees often complained about what they saw as gaping discrepancies between their paychecks and those of management, even after a recent 20 percent pay cut for managers. Although business experts say US Airways needs to maintain current levels of executive salaries to attract and keep talent, employees are not mollified. They are particularly angry that Bruce R. Lakefield, the chief executive, is keeping his $425,000 salary. ''I can't handle someone who makes $400,000 telling me to take a 21 percent pay cut,'' said a flight attendant who said she made about $24,000 last year and now lives paycheck to paycheck. Not all employees blame management exclusively for their plight. Kirk Conners, 57, a customer service representative in Detroit with 36 years seniority, say he is also mad at President Bush for not dipping into the strategic petroleum reserves to curb fuel prices, and at the industry as a whole for not raising ticket prices. ''The price of airline fuel has gone up, but the price of tickets has not,'' he said. ''How much can they cut employees' wages to subsidize fuel costs?

A.I.G., which said last week that it hoped to reach a ''prompt settlement'' with regulators and prosecutors in the matter, was actually close to an agreement early last month but balked at the idea of a monitor, and the discussions broke down. Negotiations have been renewed, but their outcome is unclear. While installing an independent monitor at A.I.G. would not be unprecedented, it would be unusual, said Lewis D. Lowenfels, an authority in securities law at Tolins & Lowenfels in New York. ''Typically when you settle these matters you want an end to it,'' he said. ''But with a monitor in there, it is open to further investigation, findings of possible violations and you really can't control where it may lead.'' According to the people briefed on the talks, the S.E.C. wanted a monitor with a fairly limited mandate: examining A.I.G.'s books to see whether other questionable, income-smoothing contracts had been sold and, if so, to whom. Regulators and prosecutors' interest in the financial contracts written by A.I.G. has heated up in recent weeks, after the lawsuit filed by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, against Marsh Inc., the world's largest insurance broker. On Oct. 21, A.I.G. disclosed that a grand jury in Indiana was investigating an insurance policy it sold to Brightpoint Inc., a cellphone maker, that helped the company conceal $11.9 million in losses in 1998. But insurance products, which can be used to smooth out companies' earnings hiccups, have drawn securities regulators' attention for at least the last two years. The S.E.C. brought an enforcement action against the PNC Financial Services Group in 2002 and sued Brightpoint last year for buying contracts from A.I.G. that it said misled investors about financial results at both companies. Each company, while neither admitting nor denying any wrongdoing, restated its results to correct the accounting treatment. A.I.G. paid $10 million to settle the Brightpoint matter with the S.E.C.; it, too, neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing. But in announcing the settlement in September 2003, the regulators said A.I.G. ''played an indispensable part'' in the fraud at Brightpoint by selling it a ''new 'insurance' product that A.I.G. had developed and marketed for the specific purpose of helping issuers to report false financial information to the public.'' The contract, regulators said, was designed to look like insurance, enabling A.I.G.'s clients to receive beneficial accounting treatment. Such policies are broadly known as finite insurance or financial reinsurance. In fact, however, the contract was actually a loan that involved no risk to A.I.G. According to regulators, the contract specified that Brightpoint deposit money with A.I.G. in the form of monthly premiums, which A.I.G. then agreed to refund to Brightpoint as purported insurance claim payments. In the PNC Financial matter, the company shifted almost $800 million in troubled or underperforming loans from its books. The loans were sold to special-purpose entities created by A.I.G. but should have been included on PNC's financial statements, regulators said. When the S.E.C. took action against PNC Financial two years ago, A.I.G. was not named in the proceedings. But on Sept. 21, A.I.G. disclosed that the S.E.C. was considering suing it over the transactions with PNC. Negotiations to settle the matter halted a few weeks later when the regulator demanded that the company hire an independent monitor to scrutinize past transactions. Joe Norton, an A.I.G. spokesman, said the company had instructed its counsel to resolve the matters quickly in terms that were satisfactory to both the government and the company. ''Those are the instructions the company gave its attorneys and the company expects them to do their jobs,'' he said. As is its custom, the S.E.C. declined to comment on its settlement talks with A.I.G. Policies that help companies smooth their earnings, used legitimately, can allow insurers or corporations to spread their risk of loss on a particular asset or business over time and to other insurers willing to take on additional risk in exchange for premiums received. But for a policy to be considered true insurance, it must involve the transfer of some risk to the party receiving the premiums. If the contract states that the premiums paid by a corporation will be returned by the insurer at a later date, then such a policy looks like a loan rather than insurance. Finite insurance has been around since the 1980's. It became enormously popular in the late 1990's as costs related to litigation in the United States rocketed and companies had an increasingly difficult time accurately assessing their potential liabilities. In this environment of unknowns, limiting exposure through finite insurance took off in popularity. Adding to the appeal was its effect of smoothing volatile earnings, which corporations have come to dread because their stocks can decline significantly when earnings take an unexpected hit. Still, insurance and accounting experts say that the potential for abuse exists in finite insurance, as illustrated by the Brightpoint arrangement. As the regulatory spotlight on finite insurance has risen, A.I.G. has maintained that its sales of these products have been minimal. Maurice R. Greenberg, A.I.G.'s chief executive, is known for playing hardball with adversaries, whether competitors, regulators or customers filing a claim. In September, when the company disclosed that the S.E.C. was close to filing suit against it on the PNC matter, A.I.G. said that it thought that ''the proposed action would be unwarranted.'' Two weeks ago, however, when the company announced its third-quarter results, Mr. Greenberg said that he was ''not looking for a fight'' with regulators and was seeking a ''resolution that is fair to our shareholders and everybody concerned.''", "title": "S.E.C.

The chairwoman, Sherry Lansing, one of Hollywood's most recognizable figures, has run the studio for the last 12 years. She said on Tuesday that she would step down when her contract expires at the end of 2005. ''I'm committed to staying until there's somebody that's great,'' said Ms. Lansing, who is 60. ''We're proceeding as if business is normal.'' Mr. Freston said that he would immediately begin looking for a successor, with an eye to finding someone who can ''help invent this new era at Paramount.'' He said he was looking to develop ''a slate of films that have a younger skew than we have had historically, and with a stronger focus on specialty films.'' Mr. Freston -- who made his mark at Viacom as chairman of its MTV Networks division -- added that he wanted Paramount to be more talent-friendly, to develop further the home entertainment unit, and to be more aggressive in holding onto the international distribution rights of movies. Sumner M. Redstone, Viacom chief executive, said he was ''really sad'' Ms. Lansing was leaving. Although he said he and Ms. Lansing were good friends, the relationship had little to do with her tenure at Paramount. ''I think her track record, past and future, is a really good one,'' he said. Mr. Freston said Ms. Lansing informed him last Wednesday that she did not intend to renew her contract and wanted to pursue career goals outside of Hollywood. ''That was the discussion,'' he said. ''I had a lot of things on my mind, but we never really got to them. I listened to her, and I believed her.'' The Los Angeles Times reported news of Ms. Lansing's intended departure on Tuesday. Her future had been the subject of speculation since the promotion of Mr. Freston and Leslie Moonves, a veteran of the company's CBS network operation, last June. The reorganization passed over Ms. Lansing's boss and close collaborator, Jonathan Dolgen, Viacom entertainment chief. Mr. Dolgen resigned shortly thereafter. A pioneer among female executives in Hollywood, Ms. Lansing paved the way for the numerous women in senior studio jobs. She ran 20th Century Fox Productions in 1980, and three years later became a producer in Jaffe-Lansing Productions. At Paramount, which she took over in 1992, Ms. Lansing oversaw a run of hits, including ''Forrest Gump,'' ''Braveheart,'' and ''Titanic,'' which was a co-production with Fox. But she has been criticized in the last several years for Paramount's weak performance, with a track record of underperforming mid-budget thrillers, remakes and formulaic fare like last year's ''Paycheck,'' a co-venture with DreamWorks SKG. Disappointments in recent months included ''The Stepford Wives,'' ''Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow'' and even the critically lauded ''The Manchurian Candidate'' and the puppet comedy ''Team America: World Police.'' This weekend Paramount will open another remake, ''Alfie,'' which market research has shown to be tracking weakly with audiences, according to one Paramount insider. So far this year, Paramount ranks seventh in market share, with just 5.7 percent of the domestic box office, according to boxofficemojo.com, which tracks ticket sales. Earlier this year, Ms. Lansing unveiled a plan to re-energize the studio. She appointed the producer Donald De Line to head production and put money into bigger-budget movies like ''Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events,'' and Steven Spielberg's ''War of the Worlds.'' (Both are co-productions with DreamWorks.) In addition, Mr. Freston and Ms. Lansing have been negotiating to buy an art-house studio to expand Paramount's involvement in specialty films. The executives looked at the independent studio Lions Gate Entertainment, which merged with Artisan last year, but decided it was overpriced, Viacom executives said. Instead they have been negotiating in recent days with Newmarket Films, which is principally a distributor of independent films like ''The Passion of the Christ'' by Mel Gibson. Mr. Freston also said he was considering a business plan to expand Paramount Classics, the art-house division run by Ruth Vitale and David Dinerstein. What Ms. Lansing's eventual departure means for one of her closest colleagues, Rob Friedman, vice chairman of Paramount's motion picture group, is unclear. He has also been associated with the studio's poor performance in recent years and has had tense relations with Mr. Freston in the past, mainly related to the handling of MTV movie projects. Mr. Friedman said he had no plans to leave. ''Sherry's not leaving for a while, so I'm going to do my job,'' he said. Since being promoted, Mr. Freston has made few major changes. But in a speech to investors in September, he outlined areas that needed work, including relations with filmmakers and cooperation among Viacom properties. Mr. Freston also said it made sense to increase the number of movies for the younger audience, partly because Viacom has expertise in the segment (it owns Nickelodeon as well as MTV). Mr. Redstone said that he and Mr. Freston ''both agree that since the movie audience is a young audience, the people that really drive the business, I think we'd bring in producers who had a connection with younger people. ''But I don't think we need a dramatic overhaul at the studio.'' Mr. Freston said he was not satisfied with the studio's performance, but believed that it was on the right track. ''It takes a long time to make changes at a movie studio, it's like turning an ocean liner,'' he said. Ms. Lansing, who started as a math teacher and became an actress, said she was proud of her record at Paramount, but wanted to pursue a ''third career'' in the nonprofit world. She is also active in Democratic politics, and is a regent of the University of California. ''The last couple of years have not been everything we wanted, we were profitable anyway. And yet, at some point, you have to move on,'' she said. ''There's a whole world out there I'm very interested in.''", "title": "Chief Plans to Leave Paramount Pictures"}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/Business", "Top/News/Business/Media and Advertising", "Top/News", "Top/Features/Movies", "Top/Features/Movies/News and Features", "Top/Features/Movies/News and Features/Studios", "Top/Features/Movies/News and Features/Studios/Paramount Pictures", "Top/Classifieds/Job Market/Job Categories/Media, Entertainment and Publishing"], "publication_day_of_month": "3", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "Movies; Business", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "Business/Financial Desk", "print_page_number": "1", "publication_day_of_week": "Wednesday", "print_section": "C", "alternate_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/03/business/media/03paramount.html", "print_column": "2", "slug": "03PARA$08"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "Jade Lenshoek Pinheiro, wearing an orange Reese's T-shirt, tight black pants and long white skeleton earrings, tried out a $129 padded barrel chair in the Dry Ice furnishings store in the shopping mall here, and decided to keep looking. ''I'd buy everything here,'' she said, gesturing to the brightly colored pillows, the metallic diner stools and even the free-standing neon palm tree, ''but I've got to compare prices at other places first.'' Miss Pinheiro, who says she spends about $100 on each of her shopping sprees, is only 11 years old. Yet she represents a shopper the home furnishings market has recently discovered and started courting avidly: teenagers and preteenage consumers with a passion for decorating their surroundings. In surveys done by Teen Vogue and by Teenage Research Unlimited, these young people say they get their spending money from chores (Jade earns $2 an hour baby-sitting for her younger sister and keeps her own checkbook), from weekly allowances and from presents from relatives. And of course, when an item is really expensive, like the frosted-glass desk here for $299, parents say they are often more than willing to help out. More retailers are rushing to take advantage of what has become a $17 billion market for room furnishings meant to appeal directly to young people from third grade through high school. It is a market, said Michael Wood, a vice president at Teenage Research Unlimited, that has ''really exploded in the last two years.'' And instead of leaving furnishing decisions to their parents, older teenagers and their 8- to 14-year-old sisters and brothers -- called tweens by retailers -- are proud, insistent even, about making those decisions themselves. Last year, teenagers and tweens spent an average of $386 to decorate their rooms -- more than double the figure of a decade ago, according to the Wonder Group, a youth-marketing company in Cincinnati. Merchants are responding. Besides Dry Ice, a $30 million private company that started on a mall cart and has grown to 40 stores from 7 in the last three years, this market is full of start-ups, some more successful than others. Paul Frank began five years ago by making wallets in a garage. He now sells sheets and pillowcases emblazoned with primitive monkey heads. As Paul Frank Industries, he puts out a brochure of home bedding for tweens, featuring the monkey heads and skeleton heads. The company has 13 stores, as well as a fast-growing wholesale business supplying department stores and specialty shops. A year ago, Pottery Barn opened PBTeen's Web site, full of flokati rugs and hanging shelves. Last week, the PB Teen site recorded 117,000 visitors; a spokeswoman said retail stores were coming next. ''About two years ago, this consumer was not addressed at all,'' said Patrick Wynhoff, the senior vice president at PBTeen. ''Teens had to find stuff for their rooms in Ikea or Target or adult furniture shops or do their own makeshift improvisations. Now everybody's hopping on the wagon.'' Limited Too, after a debacle with its stand-alone Mishmash furnishings and accessories stores for teenagers, is at it again with a new chain called Justice, for a younger clientele: ages 7 to 14. The company has already opened 33 stores, with dozens more planned for next year. The best-selling item? A $7 privacy door bell, which parents, older siblings and other would-be visitors must ring before entering. In the last year, ''Trading Spaces'' the popular television reality show, has spun off ''Trading Spaces: Boys vs. Girls.'' In one episode, a 12-year-old boy pronounced a pink room disgusting and vowed to do better; a recent show pitted Andrew vs. Caitlin, in a battle over playrooms. Tweens and teenagers are not easy to figure out, as retailers unabashedly admit. But one thing is clear, those who survey them say: parents have a lot less influence over what they buy and how they furnish their rooms than they once did. ''When I was a kid, I slept in a room with my two brothers,'' said Steve Thomas, the chief executive at Dry Ice. ''We were stuck with my parents' cast-off wedding furniture.'' Now children usually have rooms to themselves -- the American house is 50 percent bigger than it was in 1970 -- and they control much more of what is bought. Both Emily Maier, 9, and her twin brother, Brandon, said they set the table and fed the dog, in exchange for what they wanted -- ''within reason,'' added their mother, Theresa, of Allenwood, N.J. Emily knows exactly what she wants: ''I want posters, a beanbag chair, a new headboard and bookshelves and one of those locker things.'' Brandon, who describes his room as ''cool,'' said he just traded in his twin bed. ''I got a full-size bed, a bookshelf and a bulletin board, full of basketball pictures,'' he said. Eileen Joyce, the vice president for interior design at Bloomingdale's, who has been in this line of work for 25 years, says children are more involved in their rooms than ever before. ''The parents used to figure it out and tell the kids,'' she said. ''Now they ask the children, What would you like?'' Ms. Joyce said that teenagers and their tween siblings often have starkly differing tastes. ''A 17-year-old girl might want ruffles and canopies,'' she said, while ''the 13- and 14-year-olds tend to want platform beds, very modern, very sleek.'' The interest in decorating now starts well before adolescence. Holli Amalfitano, an 8-year-old with long dark brown hair, plopped happily into a $219 orange velvet chair shaped like a catcher's mitt on a trip to the mall. It was her ninth visit to Dry Ice, which sells things like bed canopies and bulletin boards -- all for the school-age set. Not far away, two 16-year-old girls, canvassing the mall without their parents, spun on two glossy-metallic diner stools. ''There's a definite switch from Pottery Barn Kids, where Mom makes the choices, with maybe a little input,'' Mr. Wynhoff of PBTeen said. Next year, he said, PBTeen plans to introduce an ''item of their dreams'' feature, which will allow kids to lobby for their deepest desires by making a list of chores they will do to earn money to pay for what they want -- or the movies and candy they will forgo. Mr. Wynhoff, while refusing to break out sales separately for PBTeen, said the unit, which is part of the $3 billion Williams-Sonoma Company, had ''exceeded all of our expectations consistently.'' Claire's, a jewelry and accessories chain for girls 7 to 17, is starting to expand its Claire's Club, until recently a room accessories section inside its regular stores. Within the last two weeks, the 1,700-store chain, starting at the Mall of America outside Minneapolis, opened its first three freestanding Claire's Club boutiques. Recently introduced items include foldable stools, cellphone holders for the desk and ''dream nets'' to serve as canopies surrounding the bed. This kind of ''soft'' home furnishings business -- versus furniture -- is thriving, said a Claire's spokeswoman. But Claire's is moving cautiously; Charlotte Russe, another tween-oriented chain, tried to do something similar with Charlotte's Room, but halted the experiment last year, after the young constituency failed to buy. These customers' critical nature is shown on a chat Web site called SmartGirl, which is run by the Institute for Research on Women and Gender at the University of Michigan. In a recent review of PBTeen, a 14-year-old named Kayla (last names are not used on the site) summed up her opinion of the collection. ''It's cool,'' she wrote, ''but don't look if you aren't prepared for high prices.'' Her conclusion? ''Low quality and expensive.'' Responding to the questionnaire, she said her favorite item in the catalog is the stuff-your-stuff bed and headboard. Asked if she had ordered anything, she responded, ''No, but I think I will because I am redecorating my room.'' Pollsters and retailers say this age group is continually gaining sophistication. Not only are many girls mini-fashionistas, but both boys and girls say they watch adult-oriented shows about houses and interior design. In a survey done by Lowe's, the home-improvement chain, 65 percent of teenagers said they had watched home makeover television shows like ''Trading Spaces,'' ''This Old House'' and ''Cribs.'' According to MarketResearch.com, these young sophisticates represent a potentially vast audience with considerable buying power. There are 23 million Americans ages 6 to 14, and 32 million from ages 12 to 19. The number of teenagers alone has risen 16.6 percent since 1990. And they have more to say about how the entire house is furnished. ''They have begun to exert influence on the rest of the family,'' said Gina Sanders, the publisher of Teen Vogue. But their own bedrooms still come first. Indeed, the most popular Teen Vogue feature is not a column about fashion. Nor is it the regular feature called ''Model Scout.'' The winner is a monthly article where a teenage reader describes how she decorated -- and, usually, says she is constantly redecorating -- her own living quarters in the family's house. It is called, simply, ''A Room of My Own.''

The disagreement with the auditing firm, KPMG, centers on calculating the value -- and likely further losses -- from the company's long-troubled computer services contract with the United States Navy. E.D.S. moved quickly to calm investors by offering reassuring guidance for the quarter, excluding the Navy contract, and noting that any added write-off would be a noncash charge. And the next day, it took the sort of action that really pleases Wall Street: It cut its payroll. The company offered early-retirement buyouts to 9,200 workers, about 17 percent of the American work force. It expects about half of them to accept the offer, reducing operating costs by about $150 million starting in 2006. The share price of E.D.S. has since fared nicely, closing at $21.16 yesterday, up 5.6 percent since the company disclosed the auditing dispute after the end of trading on Oct. 25. In the daily logic of Wall Street, this positive response may be sensible. But to industry analysts with a longer perspective, the latest trouble at E.D.S. points to larger challenges confronting the $400 billion-a-year computer services business. ''The Navy contract is a symptom,'' said Linda Cohen, a senior analyst at Gartner Inc., the technology research firm. ''This is an industry and a marketplace that is not in great shape.'' The main challenges, analysts say, are a backlog of problem contracts, an increasing need to substitute automation for labor in managing corporate data centers, and the difficulty of making the transition from low-margin outsourcing services to areas of higher profitability. To prosper, the analysts say, computer services companies must shift steadily from managing armies of workers in the computing engine rooms of corporations to offering customized packages of technology services for tasks like searching for new retail customers and helping scientists find breakthrough drugs. The future of technology services, they say, is in combining the expertise of business consultants with a deep knowledge of fields like retailing, telecommunications and banking with the skills of computing experts. The industry cannot afford to make this transformation gradually because it is so susceptible to the forces of technology-fueled globalization. Already, the basic work of computer services companies -- upgrading old programs and building new software applications -- is being sent offshore to inexpensive though well-educated workers, especially in India. Indeed, fast-emerging Indian outsourcing firms like Infosys, Wipro and Satyam are posing formidable challenges to older companies like E.D.S. Still, many problems of the American industry are homegrown. When the technology slump took hold in 2000, computer services companies were eager for revenue growth and for the next three years offered corporate clients deals that were far too sweet, analysts say. Not only was the pricing aggressive, they say, but the contracts often included performance guarantees with few controls. In effect, the companies offered big clients open-ended promises. The E.D.S. contract with the Navy, signed in 2000, was the classic misguided mega-deal. It was an eight-year contract, with total revenue valued as high as $8.8 billion, for maintaining and upgrading personal computers and networks at 4,000 Navy and Marine Corps locations. The deal has already piled up losses estimated at $1.6 billion. The value of the Navy contract on the E.D.S. books is now $700 million, which is the estimated value of its future income. A further charge could come today. In their financial analysis of E.D.S., some investors already place little or no value on the contract. E.D.S. is hardly alone in having to wrestle with deals gone sour. In September, I.B.M. lost a seven-year, $5 billion outsourcing deal with J.P. Morgan Chase that was announced in December 2002. Morgan withdrew after it merged with Bank One this year. Analysts point out that long-term, multibillion-dollar outsourcing deals usually turn out badly for computer services companies. They often mean taking over a client's technology staff and data centers, and promising the client that the job can be done more cheaply. ''My mess for less,'' as corporate executives describe such deals. The financial structure of the deals, analysts say, typically involves losing money in the early years of the service contract and betting that money can be made later. Clients eager for savings in the early years often want to renegotiate the contract when the savings end. This kind of dynamic, the analysts say, tends to leave both sides dissatisfied, suggesting that multibillion-dollar contracts will be scarce in the future. That could well mean slower growth for companies like I.B.M., E.D.S. and Computer Sciences, which have relied most on big deals, according to Rod Bourgeois, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''Top-line growth is going to be tough for them,'' Mr. Bourgeois added. ''These are the companies that have lived and died by megadeals.'' Indeed, the growth of I.B.M.'s services business, which represents about half of I.B.M.'s revenue, is slowing to an estimated 3 or 4 percent this year, excluding currency gains. I.B.M. has moved forcefully into more profitable businesses that combine consulting with technology services. But to bolster growth further, it is also buying services companies, including Daksh, an Indian specialist outsourcer with revenue of $60 million, and a European services company, Maersk, with yearly revenue of about $500 million, in a deal expected to close this quarter. Other companies are confronting new uncertainties. Cap Gemini, Europe's largest technology services company, in September reported a surprising loss for the first half of the year and replaced its chief financial officer amid speculation that it might be a takeover target. Even Accenture, a stellar performer, lowered its revenue growth expectations last month for the coming year to 9 percent to 12 percent, from earlier guidance of 10 percent to 15 percent. On Wall Street, any optimism about the industry is carefully hedged. On Aug. 23, for example, Mr. Bourgeois upgraded his rating on E.D.S. to outperform. At the time, the stock was trading around $17 and he explained that he believed analysts were overly negative about the company because there were signs that the business was stabilizing and gradually improving under Michael H. Jordan, who became chief executive a year and a half ago. At the time, Mr. Bourgeois placed a target price of $22 on the E.D.S. shares, not all that far from yesterday's closing price. Roughly 80 percent of E.D.S. revenue, he noted, comes from mature, highly competitive businesses like tending to computer networks and maintaining software applications. ''There are not a lot of attractive businesses in the mix,'' he said. ''I would be blown away if E.D.S. had revenue growth in 2005.''

The number of international players in the N.B.A. is approaching 20 percent. The team many are picking to win the championship this season, San Antonio, will start four players who were born outside the United States. China's Yao Ming is widely regarded as the world's second-best center. The first Japanese-born player, Yuta Tabuse, is a reserve point guard for the Phoenix Suns. ''When you can't pronounce the name of the player who doesn't look like you, there is a tendency to feel like you are losing something,'' Nat Irvin II said. ''But there is something going on in the world that is larger than how we play ball.'' I met Irvin two years ago at an N.B.A. rookie seminar program at which we had been asked to speak. An assistant dean and executive professor at the Babcock Graduate School of Management at Wake Forest University, Irvin is also the founder of Future Focus 2020, which is dedicated to bringing futurist thinking to urban and minority communities. Just a couple of weeks before the rookie program, a team of N.B.A. stars representing U.S.A. Basketball had been beaten for the first, second and third times at the 2002 world championships in Indianapolis. The drafting of foreign-born players by N.B.A. teams was accelerating. Kenny Smith, the former Houston Rockets' point guard and the TNT studio analyst, had voiced concerns about the loss of N.B.A. jobs for African-Americans, who for decades have dominated the league. Irvin, an African-American, made it clear to the rookies that the internationalization of the sport was no ''conspiratorial notion,'' based on the belief that ''there are too many blacks and how can we get more white players into the game?'' He said what was occurring in professional basketball was no different than what is happening in most other aspects of our society. In a recent telephone interview, he called the globalization of the N.B.A. ''a wakeup call in the black community to stop thinking that sports is the only way out,'' and a welcome one, at that. ''We live in a world in which there is a continuous search for global talent in all areas -- science, technology, business,'' he said. ''Our kids are competing in the classroom against Pakistanis and Indians and Chinese. I know there is something happening in the black community reflecting an understanding of the need to compete beyond our borders, although it often is overshadowed by sports and that'' makes him angry. At Future Focus 2020, Irvin promotes the rising numbers of African-Americans completing high school and attending college rather than worry about the N.B.A.'s gradual reconstitution. He said the attitudes in sports are too often regressive, harkening to preferences within the black community for segregated schools and complaints from coaches of historically black colleges when their recruiting base became the target of the larger football and basketball-playing universities. The charge that the N.B.A. is attempting to broaden itself racially fails to acknowledge the players of color flowing from Europe, South America and Africa -- which happens to be the market with the raw potential league executives and scouts are most intrigued by. It was, of course, the N.B.A. stars of the Michael Jordan era who helped initiate the global movement by anointing themselves America's savior in the international competitions for the purpose of expanding their ancillary revenue streams. Now the foreign youngsters who grew up wanting to Be Like Mike are competing with players born in the United States for precious few jobs. The evolutionary process should remind us that professional basketball was never the proprietary domain of African-Americans any more than it was for white players who held exclusivity into the 1950's. ''If we can get to the point where the N.B.A. is not considered the black man's way out, that's better for the black community,'' Irvin said. ''Every time I hear a kid say he wants to be something other than an N.B.A. player, that's better. When I hear a kid say he wants to own an N.B.A. team rather than play for one, that's really better. Which leads us to the most significant development of a season that began last night. Bigger than Shaquille O'Neal's relocation to Miami, bigger even than Phil Jackson's latest book, is the expansion Charlotte Bobcats' principal ownership by the Black Entertainment Television founder, Bob Johnson. This is also the season after a summer in which the reputation of the N.B.A. and especially the American players took another major hit by the United States' failure to win a gold medal at the Athens Games. More soul-searching ensued about what's gone wrong, about how the world has made up so much ground since the beat-me, whip-me, take-my-picture clinics Jordan and company conducted at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Far from playing the race card, no less a respected commentator than John Thompson, the former Georgetown coach, has blamed the American system of entitlement, the pursuit of the almighty shoe contract and television face time, that has abbreviated or in some cases eliminated the concept of apprenticeship. This, in turn, has produced a generation of players with a limited understanding of the game's fundamentals. Not to worry, Nat Irvin argued. ''What will be interesting to watch is how the American game will slowly be redesigned to reflect this new reality,'' he said. ''It will not just be global in name but in style as well.'' Which, I guess, was the academic's way of offering the hope that, sooner or later, our guys will once again learn how to shoot.

There were no reports of turbulence along the way, although some is expected in the weeks to come. A team constructed almost entirely over the last 10 months and molded mostly over the past four weeks, the Knicks enter the new season balancing optimism and reality, hoping that they will have learned each other's names come tip-off. Eventually, they may be contenders for the Atlantic Division title. For the next few weeks, and beginning Wednesday in downtown Minneapolis, they simply hope to be competent and cohesive. The schedule begins with the Minnesota Timberwolves -- who fell two victories short of a Western Conference title last spring -- and it gets harder from there. Allan Houston will not play for at least two weeks and the rotation is shaky in spots, but sometime soon, the new-look Knicks will have to develop an identity. No one can say yet what this team is capable of achieving. The Knicks know only that they need to figure it out before a tough November schedule sinks them. ''This is when you show not only your division and your conference, but the rest of the league, what you're made of,'' the veteran swingman Penny Hardaway said. ''You want to gain an identity early. And in the past, Knick teams have always had that identity when they go on the floor. Whether for toughness or physical play or whatever, we have to gain an identity in these games that we have, because we're playing great teams early. And if you can go in and beat those teams up and get wins, then that's sending a message to the rest of the league.'' Hardaway is one of 11 players wearing a Knicks uniform on opening night for the first time. Four-fifths of the starting lineup has changed from a year ago. Kurt Thomas, the lone holdover, is joined in the frontcourt by Tim Thomas and Nazr Mohammed. The backcourt is Stephon Marbury and Jamal Crawford. Together, they represent Isiah Thomas's vision for a new Knicks era. Most of the players on the roster were not with the team during its three straight losing seasons, but they carry the burden of turning it around. ''I'm very realistic,'' said Isiah Thomas, who is entering his first full season as Knicks president, ''and I go into the season with a nervous stomach, because every time the season starts, every time it's tip-off, you always have the butterflies in your stomach.'' Hopes are high, but expectations are being tempered. Knicks Coach Lenny Wilkens said he would know his team's character and potential by the time it has played 20 games. Isiah Thomas has surveyed that same span of games and, bowing to the difficulty of the schedule, has said, ''We'd be lucky to be .500.'' Eleven of the Knicks' first 20 games are on the road, including a difficult four-game trip that sends them from Indiana to San Antonio to Dallas to Houston. The Pacers are a contender to win the Eastern Conference. San Antonio is a favorite to win the West. Dallas and Houston are strong teams with the potential for deep playoff runs. Nine of the first 20 games are against teams that made the playoffs last season. ''It'd be nice to start off from Day 1,'' said Crawford, who is starting at shooting guard in place of Houston. ''If we go into Minnesota and get a win, that would be huge for us.'' The eight-game preseason provided few insights into the Knicks' collective character. Marbury, a member of the United States Olympic team last summer, played sparingly because Wilkens wanted to conserve his energy. Mohammed played just well enough to keep the starting job at center, but only because Vin Baker was not physically ready to challenge him. Mike Sweetney, hyped as a possible starter at forward, instead showed his youth and never challenged Kurt Thomas's hold on the job. Crawford dazzled when the Knicks played at Madison Square Garden, but he struggled on the road. The Knicks' defense is suspect, and it will be tested every game by a string of annual most valuable player contenders: Minnesota's Kevin Garnett, Philadelphia's Allen Iverson, Indiana's Jermaine O'Neal, San Antonio's Tim Duncan, Houston's Tracy McGrady and Dallas's Dirk Nowitzki. ''We're very capable of winning,'' Marbury said. ''I mean, if we're .500 playing the teams that we're playing, that's good. If we are above .500 when we come back, that's great.'' But no matter how the victories and defeats stack up in the first few weeks, the Knicks are already ahead of where they were a year ago, when losing had become almost expected. ''It's night and day,'' Kurt Thomas said. ''Night and day.''

A person who spoke to one of Stottlemyre's colleagues said yesterday that Stottlemyre would not be back for a 10th season as coach. The Yankees will promote Neil Allen, the Class AAA Columbus pitching coach the past two seasons, to replace Stottlemyre. Not having Stottlemyre will be a major adjustment for Torre, who has basically entrusted the pitching decisions to Stottlemyre during their successful tenure together. On the day after the Boston Red Sox surprised the Yankees in the American League Championship Series, Torre said he hoped Stottlemyre would come back and reiterated how important Stottlemyre had been to the team's four championships in the last nine seasons. But less than two weeks later, Stottlemyre decided to leave. Stottlemyre might have figured he would be blamed for the Yankees' troubled pitching in the A.L.C.S. and decided his fate before George Steinbrenner, the principal owner, could decide it. Steinbrenner is known for dismissing coaches to jolt the team, and Stottlemyre thought Steinbrenner might fire him last year. ''I'm not prepared to discuss the coaching staff at this point,'' General Manager Brian Cashman said yesterday. When Cashman was asked if Stottlemyre had contacted him, he again declined to comment. Stottlemyre did not respond to a telephone message left at his home in Issaquah, Wash. With Willie Randolph, the bench coach, looming as the leading candidate to become the manager of the Mets, Stottlemyre departing and Don Mattingly's future as the hitting coach uncertain, the Yankees are poised to have a remodeled staff next season. Mattingly has not told the Yankees whether he is interested in returning for a second year. Whenever Torre was asked about his pitchers, he would inevitably say that he first had to talk to Stottlemyre or that Stottlemyre had not yet made a decision. Torre enjoyed delegating the authority to a former major league pitcher who knew more about the art of pitching than he did, and Stottlemyre enjoyed having such a significant role. It seems unlikely that Torre will immediately give Allen as much responsibility. Torre has lost his two most trusted coaches, Don Zimmer and Stottlemyre, in back-to-back years. Zimmer left as bench coach after the 2003 season. The dugout image of the imperturbable Torre used to include Stottlemyre and Zimmer on either side of him. The Yankees' starting rotation underwent a face-lift before this season, adding Javier Vazquez, Kevin Brown and Jon Lieber and losing Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte and David Wells. In 2003, the Yankees had a 4.02 earned run average, which was third best in the league. The Yankees had a mediocre 4.69 E.R.A. in 2004. Five other American League teams, including the Red Sox, had a better E.R.A. Vazquez and Brown never pitched consistently this season, and relievers Paul Quantrill and Tom Gordon were weary when they were needed to contribute in September and October. The Yankees essentially operated without a reliable left-handed starter or a left-handed reliever. That is a deficiency Cashman will surely address for 2005. If Steinbrenner wanted to tweak Stottlemyre with statistics, he could have emphasized that the Yankees had a spiffy 3.87 E.R.A. in 2002, almost a run lower than it was this season. The Yankees had the best E.R.A. in the league in 1997 and 1998 and finished second in 1999. In Stottlemyre's nine seasons as pitching coach, the Yankees were in the league's top five in E.R.A. seven times. Stottlemyre, who will turn 63 this month, was found to have multiple myeloma, cancer of the blood plasma, on April 9, 2000. While undergoing four months of chemotherapy, he continued to coach. When Stottlemyre left the Yankees in September for a stem cell transplant and was unable to coach them to their third straight championship, Billy Connors filled in. The affable, eloquent Stottlemyre started his career with the Yankees in 1964 and won 20 or more games three times in his first six seasons. He finished with a 164-139 record and a 2.97 E.R.A. in 11 seasons. Before Stottlemyre joined Torre and the Yankees, he was the pitching coach for the Mets from 1984 to 1993. Allen, a minor league coach with the Yankees for five seasons, spent the previous four seasons with the Toronto Blue Jays. He pitched for the Mets for three seasons when Torre was their manager (1979 to 1981) as well as with the Yankees in an 11-year career in which he was 58-70 with 75 saves. Allen, who has worked with the Yankees during spring training, also spent the last month of 2003 with the club. He follows a coach who was popular and successful and a friend of Torre's, which could add stress to a stressful job.

Minaya, the Mets' general manager, called Leyland yesterday morning to outline what he was looking for from the next Mets manager, and to gauge Leyland's interest in the job. Minaya said Leyland pulled out of the running shortly after he heard Minaya's expectations. ''I let him know that if he's interested in managing again, we have interest in him,'' Minaya said. ''I gave him a description of what I'm looking for and he thanked me for considering him, but the job description was not what he was looking for right now. He said, 'I thank you for being straight with me, but I'm going to pass.''' Leyland, however, characterized the conversation differently, saying that he and Minaya came to a joint decision. ''We had a mutual agreement after we talked that neither party thought it was a right fit,'' said Leyland, who has managed the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Florida Marlins and the Colorado Rockies. ''The understanding we had worked out great.'' This is the latest contradiction between Minaya and Leyland. They first spoke early last month, when Leyland called to recommend Gene Lamont for the position, and Minaya told him he was looking for ''a young guy.'' Then last week at the World Series in St. Louis, Minaya approached Leyland after learning that he was interested in managing again. Leyland said he wanted to consider one team at a time, and they agreed to talk after Leyland was interviewed in Philadelphia on Monday. But Monday night, Leyland said that he expected the Mets to call him, and Minaya said that he expected Leyland to call him. Neither budged. When Minaya finally made contact yesterday, he told Leyland that he expected the Mets' next manager to serve for three years or longer and to fulfill duties not always asked of veteran managers. Minaya says he wants the new manager to perform community service, to travel to Latin America to observe winter baseball and to attend instructional leagues. He characterized the position as ''a 12-month job.'' ''I'm looking for a manager who is going to commit himself, not only on the baseball side, but in things outside the baseball realm,'' Minaya said. ''Certain situations are more of a one-year mind-set. I am not about a one-year mind-set. I want to work with somebody for more than one year.'' Minaya would not reveal what made Leyland balk, but Leyland resigned from the Rockies in 1999 because he said he was burned out and wanted to spend more time with his family in Pittsburgh. Asked if the off-field demands made him leery, Leyland said, ''That was part of the conversation and part of what I wanted to listen to.'' Leyland remains in the running for the Philadelphia job. Minaya will interview three finalists today, all of whom appear to be eager to work year-round. The Yankees' bench coach, Willie Randolph, and the Texas hitting coach, Rudy Jaramillo, have never managed before and the Dodgers' field coordinator, Terry Collins, is known for his energy. Minaya left open the slight possibility that another candidate could ''pop up,'' but he added that Bobby Valentine could not get out of his contract with the Chiba Lotte Marines, and he acknowledged that he would probably pick a manager from the three finalists. Minaya indicated that he could choose whomever he wants and did not need the endorsement of the team's principal owner, Fred Wilpon. INSIDE PITCH The Mets say they hope to negotiate new contracts with pitchers Al Leiter and Kris Benson in the next week and expect both to return.

Tilden High School, desperate for a winner, say they only watch the Mets in games against the Yankees. The reverend from Brooklyn, who attended Tilden High more than 30 years ago, traverses the country to preach about equality, but rarely about baseball. And the retired basketball star from Brownsville, whose very name evokes a better place, explains that he comes from a block different from Willie Randolph's. But this is no time for the neighborhood to lock its doors or bar its windows. The high school baseball players vow to reconsider their allegiances if one of their own is made the Mets' manager. The reverend, Al Sharpton, takes a break from the presidential campaign to endorse a former classmate for another high-profile leadership position. And the retired basketball player, World B. Free, promises to squash old rivalries and pull for the man he calls ''one of the kids from the building.'' For most of his 50 years, Willie Randolph has been running from that building. He has gone from the Tilden Houses on Dumont Avenue to the infield at Yankee Stadium, to a house in the New Jersey suburbs, to a spot on the Yankees' bench next to Joe Torre. But the notion that he remains ''one of the kids from the building'' is part of the reason he is considered the leading candidate to manage the team he grew up cheering. Randolph is one of three finalists to be Mets manager and will go through a second round of interviews today at Shea Stadium. The most compelling parts of Randolph's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 are the blank spaces. He has never been a professional manager, and though many assume he learned the game during 13 years as a Yankees infielder and 11 years as a Yankees coach, his baseball education actually came at the Parade Grounds and at Shea Stadium. His survival skills were honed not in George Steinbrenner's Bronx Zoo, but between the Tilden Houses and Tilden High. This part of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, more than any of his accomplishments across town, must resonate with an owner who is also from Brooklyn, who grew up when Jackie Robinson was breaking the color barrier, who went to high school with Sandy Koufax, and who still hopes to build a stadium that harks back to Ebbets Field. Fred Wilpon, the Mets' principal owner, has always been mindful of his roots. He brought a minor league baseball team to Coney Island, hired a Hispanic general manager from Queens and could now hire the first African-American manager of a major league team in New York, completing part of a legacy that cannot be measured solely by victories and losses. The Sentimental Choice Because the Mets are sentimental almost to a fault -- keeping veterans long after their prime, allowing devoted fans to take batting practice on the field and giving players' children the run of the home clubhouse -- they haven't forgotten that Randolph moved with his family to Brooklyn from South Carolina when the Dodgers were still playing at Ebbets Field, and they know that his first baseball glove was a Jackie Robinson model. From the moment he slipped that mitt over his fingers, Randolph became the centerpiece of a quintessential New York coming-of-age story. He played stickball, stoopball and punch ball outside the project where he grew up. He learned from his Hispanic neighbors how to field grounders off the rocks at Betsy Head Park. He watched World B. Free -- known simply as Lloyd back then -- shoot baskets in driving rainstorms. Randolph saved his allowance to attend his first game at Shea Stadium, between the Mets and the Cubs, and saw Billy Williams hit a home run. When he was a teenager, the Con Edison seats in the upper deck at Shea became his second home. After games, he would sit in the back seat and keep his eyes trained on Shea until it faded from sight. In 1969, when the Mets won the World Series, Randolph danced in the streets. ''That was the underdog team in town, and they had a feisty group of professionals who played hard every day,'' Randolph said recently. ''It was very special. Growing up in Brownsville, we tried to imitate Mets players.'' His businesslike persona was honed in the image of the Miracle Mets. While Sharpton led political rallies at Tilden High and while brawls broke out in the hallways, Randolph stayed on the fringes and found refuge on the diamond. He seemed incapable of making an error, on or off the field, and when the starting catcher broke his leg in his senior year, Randolph volunteered to leave his position at shortstop and hunkered down behind the plate. ''He was the kind of guy you know is there, but not because he makes you notice,'' Sharpton said Friday. ''He was not nearly as vocal or public as I was, but you always had a feeling that he had leadership abilities in his own quiet way. Willie and I talk now about how we have the same kind of personalities we had in high school.'' Some major league scouts were leery of going to Brownsville to watch Randolph play. He grew up five minutes from where Mike Tyson would later rob elderly women. Unlike Tyson, Randolph had two parents at home and a brother who was drafted by the Green Bay Packers. He met his wife in Brownsville and still takes their children back to visit. ''I remember that he was always the first one at the baseball field and the first one with his cleats on,'' said Kevin Rice, who, as a child, watched Randolph play at the Parade Grounds and is now the baseball coach at Tilden High. ''He was unassuming, but he had that spark.'' After the Pittsburgh Pirates selected Randolph in the sixth round of the amateur draft in 1972, he negotiated his contract between innings of an American Legion game on Diamond 1 at the Parade Grounds, with his youth coach serving as his agent. Randolph played in the field, then ran to the scout's car to read the fine print while his team batted. ''Any kid coming out of that neighborhood has a toughness most kids don't, brings an energy most kids don't and has a drive most people don't,'' said Mel Vitter, who helped take over the Youth Service League from his parents, and has been a close friend of Randolph's for nearly 40 years. ''Willie was never blessed with huge physical ability. He was never the strongest or the fastest. He made himself with his attitude.'' Traded to the Yankees After Pittsburgh traded Randolph to the Yankees in 1976, after one major league season, the crooner Bing Crosby made a special point of going to Yankee Stadium for the home opener to see the team's new second baseman. Crosby, then a vice president of the Pirates, thought his club had given up a future star. Randolph kept as low a profile in the Yankees' boisterous clubhouse as he had in the Tilden Houses, but he became a co-captain, a five-time American League All-Star and a steadying force on a team that won four pennants in six years. ''I remember someone back then telling me, 'Willie Randolph is in the major leagues,' and I was like, 'Whoa, I don't believe it,''' World B. Free said. ''You just didn't think he'd be the guy to make the majors. He was shy and he was quiet. I guess he was like our Superman. On the outside, he wasn't flashy, but then he'd jump over a building.'' When Randolph finally returned to Shea Stadium in 1989, he was with the Los Angeles Dodgers and had gone 536 at-bats without a home run. The Dodgers trailed by two runs with two outs in the ninth inning when Randolph bashed an opposite-field three-run homer to win the game. Little more than two years later, the Mets signed Randolph so he could finish his career where he first dreamed of starting it. Now, as he eyes Shea Stadium again, this time from the driver's seat, Randolph has six World Series rings, has tutored Derek Jeter and has watched a dynasty unfold from the Yankees' third-base coaching box. But he has also been interviewed for 11 or 12 managerial positions -- it is hard for him to remember the total -- and has struck out nearly every time. The Cincinnati Reds offered Randolph a managing job in 2000, but the pay was relatively minimal, and he turned it down. The Mets interviewed him two years ago, but they went instead with Art Howe. If Randolph does not get the opportunity this time around, the question will invariably be asked: Will he ever? And if he never gets his shot, then how can the students at his alma mater expect to get theirs? Eric Eisenberg, known as Rock, patrols the halls at Tilden High, the same halls Randolph once walked, and says, ''All that's changed is a coat of paint.'' Eisenberg, the school's basketball coach and athletic director, presides over a $14,000 budget for 28 teams. The baseball team had two bats, but one was just stolen. The sign in Eisenberg's office reads, ''The strong shall take from the weak and the smart shall take from the strong.'' ''The Baltimore Orioles hired Lee Mazzilli, and he represents one Brooklyn,'' Eisenberg said. ''Willie Randolph represents the other. For him to get hired, I think it would raise the self-esteem of the kids here, and it would give the teachers someone else to point to and ask, 'Why not you?''' When Eisenberg heard a few students talking about basketball last week, he asked whether they would care more about the Mets if Randolph were hired, and they nodded. The school security guard, James Brown, said he would go to Shea more often if Randolph were the manager. And Rice, the baseball coach, asked his players whether Randolph could help convert them from the Yankees to the Mets. ''With Willie, they told me there would be a change,'' Rice said. ''Without a doubt, I know our guys would go to more Mets games. They're excited about this. It's a lot like what Torre did for the Yankees. The team had the added benefit of hiring a manager from New York. The same thing would happen with Willie Randolph. We're all pulling for him, and 80 percent of the reason is because we're proud of him. Twenty percent of the reason is that we hope he'll donate more.'' The baseball program at Tilden was disbanded in 1992, and when the former coach Nerva Jean-Pierre helped bring it back in 1996, Randolph donated bats, balls and uniforms. He wrote a modest check. He took a few of the players to Yankee Stadium and gave them tours. Jean-Pierre looked at the students as they walked around the stadium and saw the energy in their eyes. ''A lot of those kids have friends who made bad decisions, and here was someone who made the right decisions, even if they weren't the most popular,'' Jean-Pierre said. ''It was a testament to staying focused.'' Rescuing the Junkyard The school is grateful for the bats and the balls and the uniforms, but students could also use scholarships and SAT prep courses, and maybe even a visit once in a while. Managing the Mets would provide Randolph with a platform to do more for the neighborhood that nurtured him and is now supporting him. It was here, after all, that Randolph learned how to handle the worst possible bounces and still make every play. In the back of his old high school is the field where he used to put his head down and take grounders off his chin. The dirt was usually littered with broken glass and beer bottles. One coach called it the junkyard, and the nickname stuck. Today, the glass is swept away and the dirt is covered by a layer of FieldTurf, a gleaming artificial surface just like the one at Giants Stadium. Take the Field, a program started by the Giants co-owner Bob Tisch, has supplied Tilden and many other inner-city high schools with a new place to play. In the sunshine, each blade of turf seems to reflect a beam of light. The field has become a shimmering sign of progress for those who play there, and for those who used to play there. To think that the junkyard could turn into that green cathedral, and that one of the kids from the building could get the keys to Shea Stadium, is almost enough to make Al Sharpton speechless and World B. Free spin on his axis.

Among the 58 Division I men's hockey programs, the first month of the 2004-5 season has produced a number of surprising results. Michigan (5-2-1, 3-1-0 Central Collegiate Hockey Association), which was No. 1 in the preseason U.S. College Hockey Online Poll, lost its opener, at home, to unranked Northeastern. North Dakota (4-2-2, 2-1-1 Western Collegiate Hockey Association) took over the top spot, but after a tie at unranked Minnesota State, it was replaced the next week by Boston College. The Eagles (3-1, 1-0 Hockey East) were promptly upended at Notre Dame (1-4-2, 0-3-1 C.C.H.A.) -- which was unranked. Minnesota-Duluth (5-1-2, 4-0 W.C.H.A.) rose to the top, but it lost and tied visiting Vermont (2-4-1), which won only nine games last season and was picked to finish 10th in the 12-team Eastern College Athletic Conference. Last weekend, more underdogs played well. Northeastern (2-3-1) of Hockey East continued to surprise, tying North Dakota in Boston. St. Lawrence of the E.C.A.C. swept two games at home against Miami of Ohio of the C.C.H.A., which was ranked 10th at the time. Ferris State (2-6, 1-3 C.C.H.A.) ambushed Michigan in overtime. And Quinnipiac (3-2), which joins the E.C.A.C. next year from Atlantic Hockey, served notice it was ready with a victory over the E.C.A.C.'s Dartmouth (1-1), which was ranked 12th at the time. ''There's more parity than there has been,'' Ron Mason said in a telephone interview from West Lansing, Mich. Mason, now the Michigan State athletic director, retired from coaching with the most victories (924) of any college hockey coach. ''I think it's slowly but surely getting closer all the time. When you look at some of the new leagues, maybe as a whole they're not as good as some of the traditional leagues, but their good teams are still pretty good teams. ''When you're playing nonconference games at the beginning of the season, a lot can be said for 'Hey, they're up for grabs.''' The N.H.L. lockout may have had an impact on some traditional college powers, according to the former North Dakota coach Dean Blais. Blais, in a telephone interview from Columbus, Ohio, said the threat of a shortened N.H.L. season prompted some college players to turn professional before their eligibility was up. ''Some of the premier players signed early, like Thomas Vanek and Keith Ballard out of Minnesota and Zach Parise and Brandon Bochenski out of North Dakota,'' said Blais, who is now an associate coach with the Blue Jackets of the N.H.L. ''Some of the premier players exited to get their money, knowing there was going to be a lockout, which kind of takes the elite players out of the N.C.A.A., which makes more parity.'' DIVISION III  St. Norbert's Streak Ends Last season's national championship runner-up, St. Norbert of De Pere, Wis., had its N.C.A.A. Division III-record 36-game home winning streak snapped Saturday in a loss to Rochester Institute of Technology (1-1) in Green Bay, Wis. Middlebury, the defending champion, is ranked No. 1 in the Division III online poll, despite not having started its season. St. Norbert (1-1) is No. 2. WOMEN  Fast Start for Golden Gophers Minnesota (8-0) got off to a fast start in defense of its women's Division I title. The Golden Gophers have allowed only 5 goals while scoring 51. The United States Olympic teammates Natalie Darwitz (11 goals and 17 assists for 28 points) and Krissy Wendell (12-15-27) lead the nation in scoring. Their linemate, Kelly Stevens, is No. 6 in scoring (9-9-18). Slap Shots COACHING MILESTONE -- Jerry York of Boston College, who leads active Division I coaches in victories, won his 700th, over North Dakota on Friday. York trails only Ron Mason (924) and Bob Peters (744). TURNING TO THE TUBE -- College hockey fans with satellite TV service will be able to indulge their passion this season. According to the Web site Inside College Hockey (insidecollegehockey.com), between now and March 19, more than 100 Division I men's games will be televised by a variety of channels, including College Sports TV, New England Sports Network and local Fox Sports affiliates in Minnesota, Colorado and Michigan. NAMES TO REMEMBER -- Bryan Ewing, a freshman forward at Boston University might become popular with fans of the Jets and the Knicks. His nickname is Boomer, which gives him two names associated with New York pros -- Patrick Ewing and Boomer Esiason.

It was the bling bling to end all rings. At the Palace, in the shadow of a landfill in suburban Detroit, the jewelry seemed to outshine the personality of its owners. That was certainly the case for Dave Muehring, a 50-year-old firefighter from Detroit, whose name Ben Wallace picked out of a barrel Monday to be the fan to receive a team ring at the season opener Tuesday night against the Houston Rockets. The script was perfect in an anti-Hollywood way. Detroit's grinding, team-first concept may embody a blue-collar work ethic, but in terms of glitz, glamour and superstar appeal, the defending N.B.A. champion Pistons know they are far from America's team. They wore boxing championship belts to accept their rings, then went out for a rousing 87-79 victory over the Rockets. Wallace, the team's answer to a superstar, scored 15 points and grabbed 10 rebounds. ''You can choose plenty of teams around this league and call them America's team,'' said Wallace, the two-time defensive player of the year. ''We just go out there and play team ball, and at the end of the day, we're going to be amongst the elite.'' The Pistons prize blocks over alley-oops, and they eschewed style for substance in allowing a league-low 84.3 points a game last season while putting five players in double figures on offense. True to form, each starter scored in double figures, with Rasheed Wallace leading all scorers with 24. ''It's not about, aesthetically, how it looks, or cosmetically, do we appeal to the highlights in ESPN?'' said Joe Dumars, the Pistons' unpretentious president of basketball operations, who as a guard helped lead Detroit to back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990. ''We want to go out and prove that we're the best.'' After a banner-raising ceremony -- with Commissioner David Stern in attendance -- the slightly retooled and still low-key Pistons tipped off against Tracy McGrady, Yao Ming and the Rockets under a new mantra: validate. ''Every team needs a central theme to motivate them,'' said Dumars, who played with Isiah Thomas and Bill Laimbeer during the Bad Boys era. Rasheed Wallace, whose arrival at the trade deadline last season helped galvanize his teammates, said: ''Obviously, a majority of the people thought what we did was luck. We're going to just ball-out and prove it.'' Playing in a beefed-up Eastern Conference and after losing the backups Corliss Williamson, Mehmet Okur and Mike James to free agency, the Pistons hear Coach Larry Brown harp on that theme. ''I want us to validate last year by the way we played,'' Brown said Monday. ''To prove we were a special team.'' This is not the team Brown coached in Athens. Brown, still distraught over having to settle for the Olympic bronze medal, insisted that pursuing a second title was not about redemption. Dumars has another theory. ''What I deduced is that he's ready to really embrace this team again,'' he said. ''This team will allow him to show people the message he was trying to preach this summer.'' For a nickname, Dumars called his team castoffs because they were undrafted (Ben Wallace), unwanted (Chauncey Billups, traded six times before becoming the finals most valuable player), undersized (Richard Hamilton) or misunderstood (Rasheed Wallace). Into the mix came Antonio McDyess, the boundless forward who has had three knee operations in the last two seasons and who finally seems healthy. McDyess was ejected in the second quarter for punting the ball into the stands after being called for a foul. ''I knew right away this was going to be my home,'' said McDyess, who signed a four-year, $24 million deal. ''The attitudes are great, the work ethic is great. I had the opportunity to play with a championship team.'' Validation and vindication, these themes didn't fit only the defending champions. McGrady also has something to prove. After trading McGrady to Houston for Steve Francis, John Weisbrod, the Magic's general manager, blasted McGrady's me-first attitude. ''I just want to go out and play ball and make him look stupid as far as leading my team to that next level,'' McGrady said before the game. McGrady insists that he could not be happier playing with 7-foot-6 Yao Ming, and McGrady gives a different spin to Brown's mantra of ''playing the right way.'' ''That is playing the right way when you have a guy who can establish post position down there, you got to get it to him,'' said McGrady, who scored a team-high 18 points. ''You double-team him, you're leaving me out on the perimeter'' on an isolation play. McGrady missed 12 of 18 shots. Yao had just 7 points and was 2 of 9 from the field. Before the game, Houston Coach Jeff Van Gundy blasted the perception that Yao and McGrady were worthy of adulation. ''This infatuation with Yao and Tracy are the next Shaq and Kobe -- we have to win a lot to be in the same breath as those two guys,'' Van Gundy said. ''It's not them, it's the whole team, and too often people want to put it on two guys.'' The Pistons have put it on themselves to repeat. They couldn't care less that Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal have dominated the headlines in the breakup of the Lakers, once America's team. ''Normally, I don't like the team that everybody claims to be America's team,'' the backup point guard Lindsey Hunter said. ''Cowboys, I never liked them. ''Last year, we just exemplified what a team was. A lot of people said it was ugly basketball, but in the end everybody was like, 'Wow, we were watching the Pistons play.' As long as we win, I don't care.''

With the same trainer and the same jockey and two easy victories at Philadelphia Park that were reminiscent of Smarty Jones's early campaign, the comparisons were inevitable. That may be a lot to ask of a young horse who entered yesterday's Nashua Stakes at Aqueduct with only two lifetime victories over soft competition, but, so far, Rockport Harbor is having little trouble living up to the hype. Ten months after Smarty Jones tried open-stakes company for the first time, winning the Jan. 3 Count Fleet at Aqueduct, Rockport Harbor made a smashing stakes debut in the Grade III Nashua Stakes, winning by six-and-a-quarter lengths under jockey Stewart Elliott. Rockport Harbor, a gray colt, broke alertly and quickly gained the lead without much urging from Elliott. After he shook off a mild bid from the second choice, Defer, on the turn, Rockport Harbor galloped through the Aqueduct stretch as Elliott looked in vain over his shoulder for challengers. The final time for a mile run over a fast track was 1:36.67. ''He's still just 2, but so far he has done everything we've asked, just like Smarty did,'' Elliott said. ''Still, he has a long way to go. Whether he's as good as Smarty Jones, we'll just have to wait and find out.'' If nothing else, Rockport Harbor was good enough to win a graded stakes over a handful of horses with respectable credentials. Smarty Jones, who was retired after he came up short in his bid for the Triple Crown in the Belmont Stakes, did not win a graded race until he won the April 10 Arkansas Derby in his fifth lifetime start. ''I was really impressed,'' said Rockport Harbor's trainer, John Servis. ''This was a good test for him. There were some nice horses in here. The way he did it, to me, was very impressive.'' Rockport Harbor is owned by Rick Porter, a car dealer like Roy Chapman, the co-owner of Smarty Jones. But there are as many differences between the two horses as there are similarities. Unlike Smarty Jones, Rockport Harbor, named for the Maine town where Porter has a vacation home, did not sneak up on anybody. Rockport Harbor, a well-bred horse by the 1995 Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner, Unbridled's Song, cost $470,000 at the Keeneland September yearling sales and has been the subject of attention by the news media since his first start. This is not exactly the people's horse. ''It's a lot of pressure for me and John,'' Porter said. ''As long as he keeps winning, I don't mind it. With the comparisons to Smarty Jones and all the hype, I'd have felt pretty bad if he fell on his face today and performed badly. But he proved something today. Only time will tell how good he is.'' Servis said the two horses share the trait of raw ability, but little else. ''There's not a lot of comparisons between the two, other than they're both fast,'' he said. ''This horse has a stride that covers so much ground and he goes so easily. Smarty Jones was a high-energy horse. He wanted to be a race horse and he wanted to be the best he could be. This one just has a lot of natural talent.'' Rockport Harbor paid $3.80 for $2 to win yesterday. Servis had planned to run Rockport Harbor in the Nov. 27 Remsen Stakes at Aqueduct, but has changed his mind. Instead, Rockport Harbor will be given a brief rest before he starts a 3-year-old campaign that will begin at Oaklawn Park. He is tentatively scheduled to run at Oaklawn in the Southwest, Rebel and Arkansas Derby, three races Smarty Jones swept last year before winning the Kentucky Derby. Should everything go according to plan, Rockport Harbor, Servis and Elliott will team up for another assault on the Triple Crown. ''I realize we have a long way to go and every race will mean a bigger test,'' Porter said. ''Today, he proved he can go long. He's got a great trainer, who has proven he knows how to get it done. He did it, after all, not so long ago.''

Breaking a silence of decades, Sergeant Jenkins's North Carolina drawl filled a military courtroom here as he pleaded guilty to charges of desertion to North Korea and of aiding the enemy. But he pleaded not guilty to encouraging American soldiers to desert and encouraging disloyalty. The judge accepted the pleas, and the latter two charges were dropped. Wearing his olive green uniform, Sergeant Jenkins testified about his desertion and years of privation in North Korea. ''I no longer wanted to be in the military; I just wanted to go home,'' he said of his learning just after his Christmas 1964 home leave that his unit was to be sent to Vietnam. ''I knew Vietnam was combat, jungle warfare,'' he said in response to a question from the presiding Army judge, Col. Denise Vowell. ''I had never been in the jungle in my life. How could I lead soldiers?'' Asked what he feared in Vietnam, Sergeant Jenkins said simply that as a platoon leader it ''would be very easy to get killed.'' For 10 days, he said, he mulled over trying to walk across the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone to North Korea. He testified that he had believed that the North Koreans would simply hand him to ''Russia,'' where he had planned to contact the American Embassy in Moscow, and eventually make his way home. ''I didn't know North Korea was going to keep me,'' he said. Living in North Korea until last July, Sergeant Jenkins surrendered here on Sept. 11. Although some World War II-era soldiers are still listed as absent without leave, no suspected deserter has surrendered or been captured after this much time on the run. Around 2 a.m. on Jan. 5, 1965, he said, he made his move on a night patrol. He instructed his platoon to stay behind, while he went ahead to see if a road in the Demilitarized Zone was safe. Once out of sight of his soldiers, he tied to the barrel of his M-14 rifle a white T-shirt he had brought to signal peaceful intentions to North Korean soldiers. In his testimony, he jumped to 1980. In passing, he referred to the intervening 15 years as ones of living with three other American defectors in simple peasant houses without water or electricity. Sergeant Jenkins has said one of the Americans is still alive in Pyongyang. His life changed, he said, when he was introduced to the woman who was to become his wife, Hitomi Soga, a Japanese nursing student who had been kidnapped from a Japanese island in 1978 because North Korea needed Japanese teachers for a spy school. ''Our mutual hatred for North Korea brought us together,'' he said. After their marriage, he was asked to teach English at a North Korean military academy. ''If you refuse in North Korea, you are wasting your time,'' he said. ''You are going to do it anyway. I learned that a long time ago.''

Shelby easily held his seat for the Republican Party, winning a fourth term. All six House incumbents who had opponents won by sizable margins -- even Jo Bonner, a one-term Republican, who encountered an unexpectedly strong early showing by Judy Belk, a losing candidate in 2002. Mr. Shelby's Democratic challenger, Wayne Sowell, a Social Security administrator, was the first black person ever to be nominated as a Senate candidate by a major party in Alabama. ARKANSAS As expected, Senator Blanche Lincoln, the Democratic incumbent, easily defeated State Senator Jim Holt, the Republican nominee. Ms. Lincoln's victory seemed largely assured after Gov. Mike Huckabee and Asa Hutchinson, an official with the Department of Homeland Security, decided not to challenge her. Ms. Lincoln, a freshman senator, had a $6 million campaign fund; her opponent raised less than $100,000. Representatives Vic Snyder and Marion Berry, both Democrats, and John Boozman, a Republican, won re-election as well. Representative Mike Ross, a Democrat, ran unopposed. Voters also passed a referendum banning same-sex marriage. FLORIDA President Bush won Florida, the state that went his way four years ago after a 36-day recount and a Supreme Court decision. Betty Castor, a former state education commissioner, and Mel Martinez, former secretary of housing and urban development, were in a tight Senate race for the seat being vacated by Bob Graham, a Democrat. Ms. Castor, the Democratic nominee, and Mr. Martinez, the Republican, attacked each other's records. She said he was a pawn of the White House. He said her campaign had been ''taken over and run by a very extreme left-wing feminist group.'' In southwest Florida, Connie Mack IV, a Republican who is the son of a former United States senator, won the House seat previously held by Porter J. Goss, the new director of central intelligence. In southeast Florida, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, won the House seat held by Peter Deutsch, who failed in a Senate bid. GEORGIA President Bush easily defeated Senator Kerry; it was the third presidential race in a row in which Georgians backed the Republican. Voters also approved an amendment banning same-sex marriage, although the debate is likely to linger, with talk of a possible challenge to the amendment's legality. In the race to succeed Senator Zell Miller, a Democrat who harshly criticized Mr. Kerry at the Republican National Convention and did not seek re-election, the Republican candidate, Johnny Isakson, defeated Denise Majette, a Democrat. Each is vacating a Congressional seat. In a heavily contested Congressional race, John Barrow, a Democrat, unseated Representative Max Burns, a Republican, in a district drawn to favor Democratic candidates. KENTUCKY Senator Jim Bunning, a Republican, barely held off a late charge by State Senator Daniel Mongiardo, a Democrat, to win a second term. Mr. Bunning, 73, a Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher, was coasting to re-election a few weeks ago. But the race tightened after he failed to appear at a debate and admitted ignorance of recent news from Iraq, playing into Democrats' questions about his physical and mental health. Republicans said Dr. Mongiardo had no record to speak of, and questioned his masculinity. For the House, Geoff Davis, a Republican businessman, defeated Nick Clooney, a Democrat who is a former television reporter and the father of the actor George Clooney. Voters overwhelmingly approved a ban on same-sex marriage. LOUISIANA The retirement of Senator John B. Breaux, a moderate Democrat, opened up a Senate seat in Louisiana, and Republicans claimed it last night. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, the lone Republican candidate, Representative David Vitter, had 51 percent of the vote, far more than his three major Democratic challengers. Mr. Vitter needs to hold that majority to avoid a runoff election. President Bush easily won Louisiana's nine electoral votes. In the Third Congressional District, a packed race ended with no winner. Representative Billy Tauzin, a Republican, was retiring and trying to pass his seat on to his son, Billy Tauzin III. He won a plurality, but fell far short of winning a majority. MISSISSIPPI All of the House incumbents retained their seats, putting Bennie Thompson and Gene Taylor, both Democrats, back in office along with two Republicans, Charles W. Pickering Jr. and Roger Wicker. No Democratic candidate challenged either Republican. A state ballot measure banning same-sex marriage easily passed. Gov. Haley Barbour had expressed concern that people would not understand the initiative and vote against it in error. Mr. Barbour said that he hoped the bill would be approved by at least 80 percent. As expected, President Bush easily carried the state, giving him six electoral votes. In 2000, he captured 57.6 percent of the vote in the state. NORTH CAROLINA As President Bush won easily in North Carolina, Republicans picked up a Senate seat left open by the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, John Edwards. The Republican candidate, Representative Richard M. Burr, won with a five-point lead over his Democratic opponent, Erskine Bowles, President Bill Clinton's former chief of staff. Mr. Bowles, who lost a Senate race to Elizabeth Dole in 2002, had a 10-point lead in the polls months ago. That lead dwindled as Mr. Burr ran advertisements saying Mr. Bowles was ''just like Bill Clinton.'' A Democratic bid to pick up a House seat in the state's 11th District failed as Patsy Keever lost to the incumbent Republican, Charlie Taylor, by nine points. Party control in the state's 12 other Congressional districts did not change hands. Gov. Michael F. Easley, a Democrat, fended off a strong challenge from former State Senator Patrick Ballantine. The race focused on taxes, state deficits and Mr. Easley's proposal to set up a state-run lottery to finance education. OKLAHOMA In one of the nation's fiercest Senate contests, former Representative Tom Coburn, a Republican, won handily over Representative Brad Carson to succeed Senator Don Nickles, a Republican who is retiring. Dr. Coburn, an iconoclastic fiscal conservative, campaigned as a foe of deficits and federal spending, even spending on his home state. This is a reliably Republican state, but Dr. Coburn was hurt by accusations that he had sterilized an under-age patient against her will, and committed Medicaid fraud in that case. For a while, that charge helped Mr. Carson pull even in polls, but he fell behind in the final weeks. Republicans and anti-tax groups attacked Mr. Carson as an ineffectual liberal, and he tried hard to distance himself from Senator Kerry, who lost badly here. By more than three to one, voters approved a ban on same-sex marriage. They also voted, by a wide margin, to create a state lottery. SOUTH CAROLINA In one of the nation's most heated Senate races, Jim DeMint, a three-term Republican representative, fought hard to defeat the Democrat, Inez Tenenbaum. Ms. Tenenbaum, the state education chief, had surged to become a formidable opponent. Each candidate spent a record sum to attract many of the same voters to replace Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the Democrat who was retiring. Ms. Tenenbaum tried to distance herself from the national Democratic Party in the decidedly pro-Bush state. Mr. DeMint, a conservative, challenged Ms. Tenenbaum's claim that she was independent. Many called the Democratic label Ms. Tenenbaum's greatest weakness, particularly among voters aligned with the Bush ticket. Mr. DeMint's victory means the state has an all-Republican Senate delegation for the first time since Reconstruction. TENNESSEE Tennessee, which has picked the winner in the last nine presidential elections, gave its 11 electoral votes to President Bush, who also captured the state over its native son, Al Gore, in 2000. Nine incumbents in the House, five Democrats and four Republicans, were re-elected, including the Democrat Lincoln Davis, who defeated Janice Bowling in a rematch. TEXAS With a majority of precincts reporting, it was clear that the controversial redistricting by the House majority leader, Tom DeLay, paid off for Republicans. The new boundaries pitted four House incumbents against one another, and two Democrats, Charles W. Stenholm and Martin Frost, lost their seats to Randy Neugebauer and Pete Sessions, respectively. Representative Max Sandlin, a Democrat from East Texas, lost to a former judge, Louis Gohmert, and a Democratic incumbent, Nick Lampson, battled against his Republican challenger, Ted Poe, in a Houston district. Chet Edwards, a Democratic incumbent representing north-central Texas who is more accustomed to neck-and-neck races, was struggling to hold a slight lead over his Republican opponent, State Representative Arlene Wohlgemuth. With tallies in from 76 percent of the precincts, President Bush overwhelmingly won his home state. VIRGINIA For the Second District House seat, State Delegate Thelma Drake, a senior Republican in the Statehouse, beat David Ashe, a lawyer and Marine veteran. In the Ninth, Representative Rick Boucher, an 11-term Democratic incumbent, held off a vigorous challenge by Kevin Triplett, an ex-Nascar executive.", "title": "THE 2004 ELECTIONS: STATE BY STATE -- South; For the president, some easy victories, and a crucial close one in Florida."}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/United States", "Top/News/U.S.", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Alabama", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Florida", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Georgia", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Louisiana", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/North Carolina", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/South Carolina", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Tennessee", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Texas", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Virginia", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Mississippi", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Arkansas", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Oklahoma", "Top/News/U.S./Plains", "Top/News/U.S./South", "Top/News/U.S./Southwest", "Top/News", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Alabama", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Arkansas", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Florida", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Georgia", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Louisiana", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Mississippi", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/North Carolina", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Oklahoma", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/South Carolina", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Tennessee", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Texas", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Louisiana", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Mississippi", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Virginia", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Alabama", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/North Carolina", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Oklahoma", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Georgia", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Tennessee", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Texas", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Arkansas", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/South Carolina", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Florida"], "publication_day_of_month": "3", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "U.S.", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "National Desk", "print_page_number": "12", "print_section": "P", "publication_day_of_week": "Wednesday", "print_column": "1", "slug": "03SBALABA"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "CONNECTICUT In the most watched race in the state, Representative Christopher Shays, a nine-term incumbent Republican, pulled off a victory over Diane Farrell, the first selectwoman of Westport, in Fairfield County. She had criticized his support of the war in Iraq. Senator Kerry won the state's seven electoral votes by a healthy margin. He may have been helped by the overwhelming support voters gave to Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat, who easily defeated his Republican challenger, Jack Orchulli, the former business partner of the fashion designer Michael Kors. The brutal race for the Second District, in the eastern half of the state, had been billed as one of the country's closest, but the incumbent Republican, Representative Rob Simmons, easily defeated Jim Sullivan, a former Norwich councilman. DELAWARE Senator Kerry won in Delaware, where Gov. Ruth Ann Minner, a Democrat, was elected to a second term. She defeated Bill Lee, a former Superior Court judge, who was the Republican candidate. Governor Minner and Mr. Lee sparred over education, the environment and the state's prison system, with the governor drawing criticism for her handling of a case in whicha prison counselor was held hostage and raped. The state's lone member of the House, Representative Michael N. Castle, a Republican who is a former governor, was easily re-elected, beating Paul Donnelly, a Democrat. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA Marion Barry, the former mayor caught on tape by the F.B.I. smoking crack in 1990, was elected to the City Council with 96 percent of the vote. There were few nationally notable races in this historically Democratic city, which voted overwhelmingly for Senator Kerry for president. Its Delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton, was easily re-elected. MAINE Maine was once listed as a battleground state, but Senator Kerry carried it without much difficulty, just as Democrats did in the three previous presidential elections. Slightly more than half of voters interviewed at the polls disapproved of President Bush's job performance, and they voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Kerry. The state's two House members, Tom Allen and Michael H. Michaud, both Democrats, won re-election. Mr. Michaud, in a huge northern Maine district, had the harder race. Supporters of a ballot proposal to limit property taxes conceded defeat. Opponents said the measure would have forced cuts in school budgets and municipal services. MARYLAND Maryland's senator and its eight representatives were re-elected. Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Democrat and a popular 18-year incumbent, won by 30 percentage points over her Republican challenger, State Senator E.J. Pipkin. Their campaigns echoed themes of the presidential race. Mr. Pipkin, who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of his own money on TV ads, attacked Ms. Mikulski on her votes to raise taxes and to oppose weapons programs. Ms. Mikulski said Mr. Pipkin was inexperienced and never strayed from party positions. MASSACHUSETTS There were no surprises in Massachusetts, with Senator Kerry easily winning over voters in his home state. All 10 representatives seeking re-election, Democrats one and all, also coasted to victory. Several ran unopposed. For months, there had been talk of the possibility of a special election to fill Mr. Kerry's Senate seat if he won. Several members of the Congressional delegation have expressed interest in the position and started raising money. NEW HAMPSHIRE While voter surveys had given Senator Kerry a strong lead, he had just 51 percent of the vote with 90 percent of the precincts reporting. President Bush had 49 percent, and Ralph Nader the rest. While this state, once all but guaranteed for Republicans, had seemed to be favoring Mr. Kerry in polls, New Hampshire has consistently been viewed as a battleground; in 2000, Mr. Bush beat Al Gore by just 1.3 percent, about 7,000 votes. The race for governor remained heavily contested. With 92 percent of the votes counted, the Democrat, John Lynch, was ahead by a little over two percentage points. Mr. Lynch surprised some in his fierce campaign against Gov. Craig Benson, a Republican who was criticized after some of his top people stepped down facing charges of ethical misconduct. Still, a victory by Mr. Lynch would be considered an upset in a state that has always given an incumbent a second term. Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican, easily defeated the Democrat challenger, Doris Haddock, also known as Granny D. NEW JERSEY Senator Kerry won decisively in New Jersey, despite opinion polls that showed the state's voters almost evenly divided in the final weeks of the campaign. Democrats also carried the state in the presidential elections of 1992, 1996 and 2000. Most New Jersey voters who were interviewed as they left the polls said the war in Iraq was going badly, and four-fifths of those voters said they had cast their ballots for Mr. Kerry. All 13 House members were re-elected. NEW YORK Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, won a second term by a record margin, with more than 70 percent of the vote. But the state's hottest race was in the Buffalo area, where Representative Jack Quinn's retirement gave Democrats one of their best chances to pick up a House seat. With nearly all precincts reporting, the contest between Assemblyman Brian Higgins, a Democrat, and Nancy A. Naples, the Republican Erie County comptroller, was too close to call. Mr. Higgins attacked Ms. Naples for opposing a higher minimum wage and favoring White House trade policy. She called him a tax-raising liberal. In the race for another open House seat in western New York, State Senator John R. Kuhl Jr., a Republican, defeated Samara Barend, a Democrat. On Long Island's eastern end, Representative Timothy H. Bishop, a first-term Democrat in a swing district, won against William Manger, a Republican. PENNSYLVANIA As Senator Kerry easily won Pennsylvania, a major battleground state, Senator Arlen Specter overcame an early scare to win a fifth term in a race with Representative Joe Hoeffel, a three-term Democrat. Mr. Specter had narrowly defeated Representative Pat Toomey in the Republican primary, a race that left Mr. Toomey's district in Allentown and Bethlehem to a spirited showdown in which Charles Dent, a Republican state senator, dispatched the Democratic challenger, Joe Driscoll, a real estate consultant. In Mr. Hoeffel's district, which includes upscale suburbs north of Philadelphia, Allyson Schwartz, a Democratic state senator, defeated Melissa Brown, a Republican eye surgeon, in her second try for the seat. In the state's other open seat, a suburban Philadelphia district represented by the retiring six-term Republican, Jim Greenwood, Michael Fitzpatrick held the seat for Republicans against Virginia Schrader, a Democrat. One incumbent was in danger of losing: Jim Gerlach, a Republican from a swing district east of Philadelphia, was trailing Lois Murphy, a county attorney, with a third of the ballot to be counted. RHODE ISLAND Rhode Island's four electoral votes went to Senator Kerry; the state has voted Democratic in every election since 1984, when it went for Ronald Reagan. There was no race for Senate or governor, but two Democratic representatives, including Patrick J. Kennedy, the youngest son of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, faced challenges. Mr. Kennedy easily defeated Dave Rogers, a former Navy SEAL who lost to Mr. Kennedy two years ago. Representative Jim Langevin also won. VERMONT The governor of Vermont, Jim Douglas, a Republican, was able to hold onto his office after facing a tough challenge from Peter Clavelle, the Democratic mayor of Burlington. In other races in Vermont, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat, easily won re-election, as did Congressman Bernard Sanders, an independent. In a series of debates, Mr. Douglas and Mr. Clavelle showed distinct philosophies on governing, even as they traded bitter jibes. Mr. Douglas focused his campaign on business issues, while Mr. Clavelle remained associated with the liberal policies of the Progressive Party, which he had belonged to before running for governor. In the last days of the campaign, one of the major disputes centered on Mr. Clavelle's charge that 1,000 children in the state lost health care coverage while Mr. Douglas was in office. However, Mr. Douglas is relatively popular and is considered a moderate Republican by national standards. For instance, he has openly criticized President Bush's record on the environment. In the end, he won despite overwhelming statewide support for Senator Kerry. Mr. Douglas has been involved in Vermont politics since 1972, when he was elected to the State Legislature. WEST VIRGINIA Once considered a safe state for the Democratic presidential nominee, West Virginia voted to give President Bush a second term as nearly a third of Democratic voters spurned Senator Kerry. This time, the margin was nearly twice what it was in 2000. In the race for governor, Joe Manchin, a Democrat and the secretary of state, defeated Monty Warner, a Republican and a former Army officer, and Jesse Johnson, the Mountain Party candidate. Mr. Manchin lost the governor's race in 1996. The Congressional delegation, as expected, remained the same, with the two Democratic Representatives, Alan B. Mollohan and Nick J. Rahall II, winning easily. So did the state's only House Republican, Shelley Moore Capito, whose victory was the closest of the three.", "title": "THE 2004 ELECTIONS: STATE BY STATE -- Northeast; A traditionally Democratic region tilts heavily to Kerry, a native son."}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/United States", "Top/News/U.S.", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Connecticut", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Delaware", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Maine", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Maryland", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Massachusetts", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/New Hampshire", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/New Jersey", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/New York", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Pennsylvania", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Rhode Island", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Vermont", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Washington, D.C.", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/West Virginia", "Top/News/U.S./Mid-Atlantic", "Top/News/U.S./New England", "Top/News/U.S./South", "Top/News", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Connecticut", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Delaware", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Maine", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Maryland", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Massachusetts", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/New Hampshire", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/New Jersey", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/New York", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Pennsylvania", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Rhode Island", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Vermont", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/West Virginia", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Rhode Island", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Washington, D.C.", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Maryland", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/West Virginia", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Vermont", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/New Jersey", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/New Hampshire", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Massachusetts", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Pennsylvania", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Maine", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Delaware", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/New York", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe/Britain", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/Europe/Britain/England", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Connecticut"], "publication_day_of_month": "3", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "U.S.", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "National Desk", "print_page_number": "12", "print_section": "P", "publication_day_of_week": "Wednesday", "print_column": "1", "slug": "03SBCONNE"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL American League  OAKLAND ATHLETICS -- Agreed to a two-year contract extension of their affiliation with Sacramento of the PCL.

Later on Tuesday, courts in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania issued rulings on two of the most contested legal issues in this year's election: who, aside from voters and officials, may be present in polling places and who can vote by provisional ballot. The Supreme Court ruling was by Justice John Paul Stevens, who is designated to hear emergency appeals from the federal appeals court in Cincinnati. Justice Stevens refused to suspend a decision issued hours before by the appeals court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The appeals court ruled late on Monday night that Ohio Republicans could enter polling places to challenge voters there. The appellate decision reversed rulings from two Ohio district judges that had barred the challengers. The plaintiffs in the two lawsuits, Justice Stevens wrote, ''allege that Ohio Republicans plan to send hundreds of challengers into predominantly African-American neighborhoods to mount indiscriminate challenges at polling places, which they claim will cause voter intimidation and inordinate delays in voting.'' Justice Steven called the accusations ''undoubtedly serious.'' But he said time was too short for the court to render a considered decision. ''Moreover,'' he added, ''I have faith that the elected officials and numerous election volunteers on the ground will carry out their responsibilities in a way that will allow qualified voters to cast their ballots.'' That ruling left intact a 2-to-1 decision of the Sixth Circuit. In the same court on Tuesday, a different panel, also divided 2 to 1, reversed a trial court ruling excluding the news media from polling places in Ohio. ''Democracies,'' the two judges in the majority wrote, ''die behind closed doors.'' A third federal appellate ruling, from a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, limited the kinds of voter challenges that Republicans in Ohio could make. That ruling, issued late Monday night, was overturned Tuesday afternoon by the full Third Circuit. The later decision effectively overturned a ruling Monday by a federal judge, Dickinson R. Debevoise in Newark, who ordered the Republican National Committee not to challenge Ohio voters using a list prepared by local Republicans. The list is based on mail returned as undeliverable. Judge Debevoise based his order on a 1982 decision that prohibited the Republican National Committee from using so-called ballot security measures to frustrate efforts by minorities to vote. The judge ruled that the 1982 decision, a consent order entered as part of a settlement in New Jersey, was national in scope and remained in effect. New lawsuits were also filed Tuesday. In Ohio, a voter, Sarah White, filed suit in federal court in Toledo to challenge a directive from the secretary of state, J. Kenneth Blackwell. Mr. Blackwell said voters who had requested but not received absentee ballots could not vote by provisional ballot. The ruling was required, he said, to prevent double voting. In that case, Federal District Judge David A. Katz ruled in Ms. White's favor on Tuesday afternoon and ordered Mr. Blackwell to advise election officials that they must issue provisional ballots to all who appear at a polling place and claim to be eligible to vote. Another voter, Audrey J. Schering, filed suit in federal court in Cincinnati over how provisional ballots were to be counted. Ms. Schering said Mr. Blackwell had failed to issue clear and consistent directions to officials in Ohio's 88 counties, inconsistencies prohibited by the United States Supreme Court's 2000 decision in Bush v. Gore. In Florida, a judge in Seminole County ordered Democrats to stop ''further intimidation'' of Republican monitors. The poll watcher who sued, J. Thomas Monk, objected to a letter from the Democratic National Committee. ''Should a challenger make a knowingly false challenge,'' the Oct. 28 letter said, ''that person could be subject to criminal prosecution.''

Velella, the borough's Republican Party chairman and a power broker who was convicted of felony bribery charges earlier this year. But that seat, which includes portions of Westchester County, is now moving into the Democratic column after yesterday's election of Jeffrey Klein, an assemblyman who defeated two other candidates in one of the most closely watched contests in New York State. It was one of two Senate seats the Democrats had counted on in this year's elections in their quest to win control of the Senate over the next four years. The Republicans have long held a majority of several seats. In the other closely watched Senate contest, the Democrats also won a hard-fought race yesterday in a district in the Bronx and East Harlem, where State Senator Olga A. Mendez, a 26-year incumbent who became a Republican two years ago, suffered a lopsided defeat to City Councilman Jos\u00e9 Marco Serrano. The seat, formerly held by Mr. Velella, had been targeted by the Democrats virtually from the moment Mr. Velella resigned in May. In the end, the party poured its resources into the races, adding it to the more than $1 million Mr. Klein had already raised from his effort to form a campaign for the race for attorney general in 2006. The state's Republican leaders placed their support behind John Fleming, a former police detective who coordinated security operations for Rudolph W. Giuliani when Mr. Giuliani was mayor. Mr. Fleming received strong support from Mr. Giuliani and Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, in a district that elected Mr. Velella to the Legislature for nearly three decades. But their support came only after a contentious Republican primary. In that race, last September, the Republican leaders strongly supported Assemblyman Stephen B. Kaufman, a Democrat, who ran in both the Democratic and Republican primaries. After losing the Democratic primary to Mr. Klein and the Republican primary to Mr. Fleming, Mr. Kaufman remained in the race, running on the Conservative and Independence Party lines. As it turned out, Mr. Kaufman, who has represented a portion of the Senate district for years, was a formidable third-party candidate. He campaigned vigorously, even though he had lost the Democratic and Republican primaries. With 91 percent of the vote counted in unofficial results reported by The Associated Press, Mr. Klein had 51 percent of the vote, with Mr. Fleming receiving 37 percent and Mr. Kaufman getting 12 percent. While it is a Democratic area, the 34th State Senate District, which is shaped like a horseshoe and stretches around the northern Bronx and includes parts of Westchester County, is moderate to conservative in its political leanings. It voted overwhelmingly for Gov. George E. Pataki two years ago, and split evenly two years earlier in the United States Senate contest between Hillary Rodham Clinton and her Republican challenger, Rick A. Lazio. Mr. Velella won the district handily through much of his career. The race in East Harlem was a crushing defeat for Ms. Mendez, who had once achieved a status that made her something of a political icon. Ms. Mendez, 79, was the first Puerto Rican woman elected to a legislature on the United States mainland. Until she switched parties two years ago, she had been a lifelong Democrat. She explained the move by saying that becoming a member of the majority party would help her deliver more for her district. But in the end, Mr. Serrano, 32, won overwhelmingly, as a result of several factors. For one thing, the district was radically redrawn after the 2000 census. It is no longer largely East Harlem and northern Manhattan but now includes a large swath of the south and west Bronx that account for more than 60 percent of the district's voters. Also, Mr. Serrano benefited from widespread name recognition, particularly in the Bronx, where his father, United States Representative Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano, has won re-election overwhelmingly for years. With 100 percent of the votes counted, Jos\u00e9 Marco Serrano received 81 percent of the vote, with Ms. Mendez winning 18 percent. In an interview last night, Mr. Serrano said that his victory reflected the fact that voters resented Ms. Mendez siding with the Republican majority in the State Senate. ''The Republican Party has misunderstood the needs of communities like these, communities of color and poor communities,'' he said. ''And unless we get an increase in the minimum wage and funds for school, we will continue to live in an unfavorable situation.''

At 12:45 a.m., after Fox News and then NBC called Ohio for Mr. Bush, senior staff members watching election returns in the Roosevelt Room hurried over to the White House residence, evidently to put finishing touches on the president's victory speech and prepare for his arrival at an election night party at the Ronald Reagan building on Pennsylvania Avenue. Then Senator John Edwards, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, made a public appearance in Boston saying the Democrats would fight on, and the senior staff and the president were left hunkered down in the White House residence at 2:45 am. It had been a see-saw day and night since early Tuesday, when surveys of voters leaving polling sites had showed Senator John Kerry beating Mr. Bush nationally and in crucial swing states. Karl Rove, the president's chief political adviser, had been so concerned about the polls that he spent part of his afternoon sending e-mail messages to influential Republicans, telling them to disregard the polls, which he said were not an accurate barometer. Mr. Rove noted that those polls were wrong in 2000, when they had Al Gore beating Mr. Bush by three or four percentage points. By shortly after 9:30 p.m., the president had a small group of reporters and photographers up to record what appeared to be a relaxed family tableau. ''Why don't you all take the rest of the night off,'' Mr. Bush told reporters. He said: ''We're very upbeat, thank you. I believe I will win.'' While Mr. Bush entertained some 30 family members and friends at a buffet dinner upstairs in the residence, Mr. Rove was downstairs in what he jokingly described as his ''bat cave,'' a temporary office set up in the old family dining room on the state floor of the White House to monitor returns. He had links there to Bush campaign headquarters in Arlington, Va., and the offices of the Republican National Committee on Capitol Hill. Mr. Rove shuttled among the dining room, the upstairs family quarters and the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing, where senior staff members and longtime aides like Karen P. Hughes had dinner and watched the returns on television. Several times in the course of Tuesday evening, Mr. Bush's father was spotted wandering from the family quarters into the West Wing to greet staff members and perhaps walk off the tension. ''I'm feeling good now,'' he said to reporters around 10:30 p.m. as he headed from the West Wing to the colonnade that borders the Rose Garden. Mr. Bush began his day Tuesday in light rain at the Volunteer Fire Department in Crawford, Tex., where he voted with his wife and twin daughters. His eyes were puffy from a 19-hour, seven-stop, six-state campaign swing the day before, and he appeared tired, calm and wistful as he spoke to reporters after voting. ''It's such a wonderful feeling to vote,'' Mr. Bush said. ''This election is in the hands of the people, and I feel very comfortable about that. The people know where I stand. I've enjoyed this campaign. It's been a fantastic experience traveling our country, talking about what I believe and where I'm going to lead this country for four more years. You know, there's just something refreshing about giving it your all and then saying the people will make the right decision. And I believe I'm going to win.'' From Texas, Mr. Bush flew for one last stop in Ohio, where he dropped in on the state's Bush-Cheney headquarters in Columbus to thank campaign workers. Mr. Bush took the phone from a volunteer, Mick Turner, who was making calls urging voters to the polls and said: ''Julie. This is President Bush calling. How are you? No, I promise you it's me.'' Mr. Bush added: ''I'm proud to have your support. I appreciate you taking my phone call. Thank you so very much.'' Mr. Bush then hung up and said to reporters, ''1-0.'' Vice President Dick Cheney ended his campaign on Monday with a new accusation against Mr. Kerry, saying the Democratic candidate consulted polls before deciding how to react to the Osama bin Laden tape on Friday. The Kerry campaign denied the assertion, saying the vice president offered no evidence. Mr. Cheney spoke in Colorado Springs, a heavily Republican community, after an overnight trip to Hawaii. Mr. Bush was back at the White House by midafternoon Tuesday, when he worked out on an elliptical trainer. His sister, Doro, two of his brothers, Neil and Marvin, and his mother were also at the White House. A dozen years ago, Mr. Bush was at the White House the night his father lost to Bill Clinton, and for much of his presidency he has been determined to avoid a similar defeat. At a rally in Albuquerque on Monday night, Mr. Rove was asked how Mr. Bush would compensate in the Electoral College if he lost Ohio. ''We're winning Ohio,'' Mr. Rove relied. ''And we will win Ohio.'' Then he repeated it like a mantra, or a wish: ''We will win Ohio. We will win Ohio. We will win Ohio. We will win Ohio. We will win Ohio.''

Cunningham, the city's first black mayor, who died of a heart attack in May. With 166 of 184 precincts reporting, Mr. Healy had received 28 percent of the vote. His closest competitor, Assemblyman Louis Manzo, had received 24 percent. Acting Mayor L. Harvey Smith had 22 percent. Mr. Healy declared victory shortly after 10 p.m. at a post-election party in an Italian restaurant here and said he planned to focus on decreasing crime by adding new officers and instituting a gun buyback program. ''We have to unify the city,'' he said. The victory capped a campaign that lived up to this city's reputation for pugnacious politics. Mr. Healy's election in the race came less than month after a picture of him, naked and slumped over his porch after a night of drinking, was posted on the Internet. Another candidate, Steve Lipski, had his campaign recreational vehicle pelted with eggs. Nearly every campaign complained that dozens, if not hundreds, of their signs had been painted over or torn down. And a handful of disputes involving minority voters arose at polling places, requiring judicial intervention. As the winner of the special election, Mr. Healy will serve out the rest of Mr. Cunningham's term, which ends next May. Another election will be held then for a four-year term. Many of the runners-up in the mayoral contest said they were considering another run in May, though Mr. Healy's election was widely seen as a precursor to victory. Bret D. Schundler, who won a special election for mayor in 1992 with only 18 percent of the vote, went on to serve two terms before running unsuccessfully for governor in 2001. The first complaints of election shenanigans appeared around lunchtime. Mr. Smith's campaign complained that minority voters were being denied provisional ballots. Lawyers for his campaign went to Judge Mark Baber of Hudson County Superior Court, who directed the superintendent of elections to make sure that poll workers understood the rules and to pass out ballots when appropriate. In another Hudson County race, a former Assembly speaker, Joseph Doria, was elected to fill the rest of the term of Mr. Cunningham's other elected post, state senator. Mr. Doria, the mayor of Bayonne, was selected as the interim senator earlier this year by the Hudson County Democratic Committee.

Al Franken, the Democratic comic, muttered an oath under his breath. A faint cry of ''Let's go, Kerry'' from behind the four-story platform of lights and speakers quickly faded out. One Kerry volunteer pointed a finger at another and said determinedly, ''Not over.'' But her friend just shook his head. Then, for a full five minutes, there was silence. NBC News was flicked off, and a graphic of a waving flag filled the enormous screens. A man walked onto the stage, said nothing, and walked off again. Finally, nine young members of the Greater Massachusetts Gospel Choir strode to the microphones. First one woman, in a proud, bold a capella, then the chorus, and then, even some in the crowd, belted out ''God Bless America'' into the bitter, rainy night. The sadness came suddenly and stubbornly to the Kerry crowd. All day, Mr. Kerry and his aides had seemed calm and confident, with whispers of transition talk pervading the air. A half-hour after Mr. Brokaw and his colleagues at competing networks called the race for Mr. Bush, Mr. Kerry's campaign manager said the Democrats would not concede the race, noting that all of Ohio's ballots had yet to be counted. A young advance man in a red and blue hockey shirt with ''Kerry'' on the back stalked the media center, saying, ''It's not over yet. We're going to win.'' At 1:50 a.m., the Jumbotrons had been switched to CNN, whose anchor, Wolf Blitzer, described Ohio as a ''green state'' -- too close to call for Mr. Bush or Mr. Kerry, and the Democrats here seemed reincarnated, letting out a collective whoop. Just before 2:30 a.m., Mr. Kerry's running mate, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, appeared on Copley Square and spoke for exactly one minute. ''It's been a long night,'' he told the crowd, as if it needed telling, ''but we've waited four years for this victory, we can wait one more night.'' Mr. Kerry himself remained at his home in Beacon Hill, where he had been watching returns with his wife since wrapping up four hours of 38 satellite interviews with television stations in swing states earlier that afternoon. It had been a nostalgic, sentimental day for the Democratic presidential nominee, starting with a tearful tribute to his traveling staff, then an emotional trip to the polls with his adult daughters, followed by a traditional Election Day lunch. As he has every time his name has been on a ballot since 1982, Mr. Kerry washed down a dozen littlenecks with dark ale at the historic Union Oyster House near Quincy Market. There was just a bigger mob around the beige wood bar, a lot more at stake. ''He said, 'You didn't think I was going to miss this, did you?''' said Chris Greeley, who was his driver at that inaugural Election Day lunch 22 years ago and who has sat on the next stool ever since. ''If it's possible to relax with 300 people across the street and 40 cameras, he was. For a guy in one of the closest elections in years, he wanted to be there, and wasn't in a rush to go. He savored it.'' But Mr. Kerry quickly snapped back into campaign mode upon meeting a couple from Michigan down the bar. ''Did you guys vote before you left?'' he asked. ''Otherwise I'm sending you back there.'' Earlier, at the polling place at the historic statehouse downtown, Mr. Kerry folded his 6-foot-4 frame over to put his face perhaps five inches from his own name on the ballot, borrowed his wife's reading glasses, then slowly, deliberately filled in five ovals with a black felt-tip pen. ''I don't think anyone can anticipate what it's like,'' he said afterward, ''seeing your name on the ballot for president.'' Flying here from Lacrosse, Wis., Mr. Kerry presented his traveling staff with engraved silver picture frames, and was jaunty as he handed out red fleece jackets to reporters in the entourage, suggesting to various reporters that they try bigger sizes. He then gave seven journalists who had followed him the farthest silver candy dishes engraved to memorialize the ''Champagne Lounge,'' as they called the back of the buses they rode through Iowa last winter. Asked what he most wanted to do on Wednesday morning, Mr. Kerry said, ''I don't know, honestly.'' ''I mean, I don't know how late tonight will be,'' he explained. ''Got to roll with the punches.'' In an understatement, he added, ''Hopefully have a few meetings of importance.'' The athletic Mr. Kerry said he was ''so intent on getting back in shape,'' and planned, regardless of the results, to take a bike ride on Wednesday morning. ''I cannot tell you how excited I am to sleep in my own bed,'' he said.

Approved better than two to one, the referendums in four ballot propositions authorized bonds totaling $255 million, the largest amount ever submitted in a single election on the Island. Environmental, business and civic groups as well as elected officials and editorials all supported the initiatives. Some homeowners, weary of burdensome local taxes, were opposed. Supporters said that the various propositions would raise taxes by $7 to $39 a year for a typical house. With more than 95 percent of the votes counted in Suffolk County, both a countywide proposal and one in Brookhaven were winning more than two to one. In Nassau, with about 80 percent of the vote counted, the countywide proposal was winning three to one, and a proposal in Oyster Bay was ahead more than two to one. Since the 1970's, Suffolk has spent nearly $400 million on preservation, a concept it pioneered. It now has an additional $75 million to buy more of the sprawling county's farmland and other open space. A novel feature of Suffolk's latest proposal would foster more moderately priced housing by allowing for the transfer of development rights from preserved space to downtowns and commercial areas where denser building would be allowed. Neighboring Nassau County, smaller than Suffolk and mostly built up, is new to the preservation effort with its first-ever countywide referendum for open space, for $50 million. Brookhaven voters approved a $100 million proposal to preserve space in their town, which has by far the most land of any town on the Island. Two years ago voters there approved a $20 million bond issue for preservation. Voters in Oyster Bay authorized a $30 million bond issue for their town, which has most of Nassau's remaining open space. The money is to replenish a fund approved four years ago for open space preservation.

The gains by Democrats were not enough to end the state's unique brand of divided government, in which Democrats have controlled the State Assembly and Republicans have controlled the Senate without interruption for three decades. Indeed, the two men who control the Legislature, State Senator Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican representing Rensselaer County and part of Saratoga, and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, were easily re-elected: Mr. Bruno faced no opponent, and Mr. Silver faced Carrie Sackett, a largely invisible opponent from a minor party. Democrats reclaimed the seat they lost when State Senator Olga A. Mendez of East Harlem left their party and became a Republican. With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Jos\u00e9 M. Serrano, a Democratic city councilman from the Bronx, was beating Ms. Mendez with more than 80 percent of the vote, according to an unofficial tally by The Associated Press. In Brooklyn, Democrats held on to the seat that opened up when Senator Seymour P. Lachman retired by electing Diane J. Savino. Democrats won a hard-fought contest to pick up the seat that was vacated when former State Senator Guy J. Velella, a Bronx Republican, pleaded guilty to a bribery-related charge this year. Jeffrey D. Klein, a Democratic Assemblyman in the Bronx, beat two other candidates, including John Fleming, a former police officer. And two Republican senators were locked in close races to hold on to their seats. In Westchester, Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Republican seeking his 10th term, found himself facing an unexpectedly strong challenge from Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democratic county legislator. With 90 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Spano was leading by 553 votes. In the Syracuse area, Senator Nancy Larraine Hoffmann, a 10-term incumbent who switched parties to join the Senate's Republican majority in 1998, was losing by 1,000 votes to her Democratic challenger, David J. Valesky, with all but one of the 263 precincts reporting. She said the election would be decided by absentee ballots. The Democrats benefited from the coattails of John Kerry's presidential campaign, which drove up Democratic turnout in New York; from growing dissatisfaction with state government; and from the fact that registered Democrats now outnumber registered Republicans in New York by more than five to three. And in a local race with statewide implications, P. David Soares claimed victory in his bid to become the Albany district attorney. Mr. Soares ran on a platform against the state's Rockefeller-era drug laws. He ran on the Working Families Party line and the Democratic line, unseating a sitting Democratic district attorney and dealing a severe embarrassment to the vestiges of the once-omnipotent Albany Democratic machine. Only a handful of races across the state were competitive yesterday, but in Albany, where incremental change is seen as monumental, it is considered a very big deal when even a few seats change hands. Still, in a year in which the ways of the State Legislature came in for widespread criticism and led to a new round of calls for the reform of state government, a vast majority of state lawmakers were re-elected easily. Because each house of the Legislature is given the power to draw districts to benefit its incumbents, and each party funnels lots of money to help incumbents who are at risk, there are rarely many competitive races for the Legislature. Sometimes the opposition stays home altogether: a third of the state's lawmakers faced no major-party opposition yesterday, and a quarter of them faced no opponents at all. On the surface, it hardly seemed like an auspicious year for incumbents to seek re-election. The Legislature failed to pass the state budget on time for the 20th year in a row, and it marked the dubious milestone by passing the latest budget in state history. The Legislature and Gov. George E. Pataki failed to comply with a court order requiring them to fix New York City's public schools. Their inability to reach a compromise on school financing led them to send the matter back to court. And once again, despite their agreement that the state's Rockefeller-era drug laws are too harsh, they failed to agree how far they should go in softening them. Even the creaky, aging voting machines that most New Yorkers used yesterday were a testament to Albany's gridlock. The state failed to agree on how to spend federal money that was earmarked to modernize the election system. But while the state's voters have long expressed anger at Albany, they have historically supported their local lawmakers. That tension was very much in evidence in Westchester, where Senator Spano faced an unexpectedly tough challenge from Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democratic county legislator. Sharon O'Donnell, a community activist and mother of three in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., who voted for Ms. Stewart-Cousins, said she was tired of the gridlock among state lawmakers. ''It seems like it's very bureaucratic in Albany, and there's not enough action,'' she said. ''Spano has had his turn, and she seems like a breath of fresh air.'' But Tom Donohoe, a retired New York City schoolteacher, said Mr. Spano was not to blame for the morass in Albany and praised his work on behalf of the district. ''It's a structural problem that is very difficult to do much about,'' he said after casting his vote for Mr. Spano. ''There were similar gridlocks in the 19th century. It's all called politics.'' The least democratic county in the state may very well be Queens, where nearly three-quarters of the borough's representatives in Albany faced no opponents in yesterday's election. ''District lines are drawn to protect the incumbent and protect his re-election,'' said Dick Dadey, the executive director of the Citizens Union, a nonprofit civic group. ''This is the biggest problem facing the reform Albany movement to ensure competitive elections. In New York, the Board of Elections does a reasonably good job in making sure that the votes of citizens count, but the real question is: Do they matter?'' Even lawmakers who might be expected to be vulnerable this year faced little or no opposition. Roger L. Green, who resigned his Assembly seat this year after he pleaded guilty to billing the state for false travel expenses, faced only token opposition. His Brooklyn district was redrawn in 2002 to exclude the home of his main opponent in past elections, as the State Assembly refused to release its own report condemning his actions. And Assemblyman Adam Clayton Powell IV, who was named in two police investigations this year involving separate allegations of rape but was never charged with any crimes, faced no opponents in his East Harlem district. ''An obvious question is whether reform has any traction,'' Gerald Benjamin, a professor of political science who is dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the State University at New Paltz, said in an e-mail. ''There may be some straws in the wind in the election, but it will be the post-election follow-up that is crucial.''

With 44 percent of the precincts reporting, the vote was 52 percent for Mr. Shays and 48 percent for his opponent, Diane Farrell, a first selectwoman of the town of Westport. Mrs. Farrell conceded about 10:30 p.m. ''I knew she would be formidable,'' Mr. Shays said, addressing supporters at his headquarters at the Norwalk Inn. ''But I said to my staff that we would win this race if we did a good job.'' In another contentious Connecticut race, Congressman Rob Simmons, a Republican, defeated Jim Sullivan, a Democrat and former Norwich councilman, after an unexpectedly tough challenge. With 83 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Simmons had 56 percent, Mr. Sullivan 44 percent. The races were the most notable among several that the region's Congressional Republicans faced in a year when Democrats were hoping to capitalize on John Kerry's popularity in the New York City area. But in the end, all incumbents, Democrats and Republicans alike, appeared to have won re-election. In upstate New York, the two parties were battling last night to fill a vacancy in the 27th Congressional District, in the Buffalo area. Republicans picked up another vacant seat, in the 29th Congressional District, in the Southern Tier. On Staten Island, Representative Vito J. Fossella, the only Republican representing New York City in Congress, defeated a Democrat, Frank J. Barbaro, a former assemblyman, retired State Supreme Court justice and onetime mayoral candidate. With 78 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Fossella had 60 percent of the vote and Mr. Barbaro had 40 percent. Mr. Barbaro, 76, who is also a former longshoreman, put together a formidable collection of supporters, including labor unions. But Mr. Fossella, 39, is popular in his district. In New Jersey, another Republican incumbent, Representative Mike Ferguson, won decisively in the Seventh Congressional District, defeating a little-known Marine officer named Steve Brozak, a former Republican who had returned home from a tour of duty in Iraq saying he was disillusioned with his party. With 100 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Ferguson had 57 percent of the vote to Mr. Brozak's 41 percent. Mr. Brozak, who was given a prime-time speaking role during the Democratic National Convention in Boston, tried to tie Mr. Ferguson, a two-term incumbent, to the conservative Republican agenda in Washington, while Mr. Ferguson cast himself as a moderate. Mr. Brozak phoned Mr. Ferguson shortly before 10 p.m. to concede. The challenge in Connecticut against Mr. Shays, a moderate Republican, stirred national attention. He had become a fixture in state politics by representing the Fourth Congressional District for eight terms. By virtue of his 17 years in the House, where seniority equals power, he has been a prominent voice for his state at a time when power in Congress is concentrated largely in the hands of conservatives from other regions, like Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority leader. Mr. Shays managed to retain his seat over the years despite demographic shifts that have resulted in more registered Democrats than Republicans in the district, which is made up mostly of Fairfield County's affluent communities. Mr. Shays attracted Democratic support partly because he had cast himself as a moderate willing to defy the party's leadership on major issues, chief among them a federal law imposing new restrictions on campaign spending and contributions. But his Democratic opponent, Mrs. Farrell, proved to be a formidable challenger, primarily by using Mr. Shays's party affiliation against him and even invoking Mr. DeLay in her speeches and in debates. Specifically, Mrs. Farrell accused Mr. Shays of being far less moderate than he had made himself out to be, noting, among other things, that he had voted with his party 78 percent of the time. In Connecticut's other hard-fought race, Mr. Simmons had been seen as vulnerable. A two-term incumbent, he represents a district where Republicans make up less than one-quarter of the registered voters. A self-described Rockefeller Republican, Mr. Simmons stressed his moderate credentials, like his support for abortion rights, and barely mentioned President Bush, apparently mindful of Senator Kerry's immense popularity in the district. But national Democrats poured money and other resources into the district, sensing that Mr. Kerry's wide lead over Mr. Bush in polls in the district, reaching as high as 20 points, would provide possible coattails for Mr. Sullivan. The Democrat, in turn, hammered away at Mr. Simmons's ties to the president, noting that the congressman had voted in favor of the war in Iraq and had supported the Republican Party's policies on tax cuts and education. Democrats embarked on a vigorous effort to take the Congressional seat in the Buffalo area after the incumbent Republican, Jack Quinn, announced this year that he would not seek election to a seventh term. The Democratic candidate was Brian Higgins, a state assemblyman and a former Buffalo city councilman. The Republican candidate was Nancy A. Naples, the Erie County comptroller. The Republicans, who were caught off guard by Mr. Quinn's decision to retire, fought hard to keep the seat, though Democrats thought it was within their reach, given the large numbers of Democrats in the district. At 11:30 p.m., the race was too close to call. In the Southern Tier of New York, Democrats tried to win the seat vacated by the incumbent Republican congressman, Amo Houghton, in a district that is heavily Republican. In that race, John R. Kuhl Jr., a Republican who was member of the state Legislature, defeated a Democratic newcomer, Samara Barend, in a race that became particularly ugly after the disclosure of sealed divorce records alleging that Mr. Kuhl had once threatened his wife at gunpoint. With 97 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Kuhl had 51 percent and Ms. Barend had 41 percent.

Schumer, Democrat from Brooklyn, won re-election to a second term yesterday by an enormous margin, outpolling the former top vote-getter in the state, the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and fueling talk that he may soon become a candidate for governor. Mr. Schumer defeated his opponents with more than 70 percent of the vote, a figure that exceeded Mr. Moynihan's record for a Senate election of 67 percent in 1988. His margin is doubly noteworthy because Mr. Moynihan's record was set in his run for a third term, after 12 years in the Senate, whereas Mr. Schumer is completing his first term. With 96 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Schumer had 71 percent, or 4.2 million votes, while the Republican, Assemblyman Howard D. Mills of Goshen in Orange County, had 24 percent, or 1.4 million votes. The Conservative Party candidate, Dr. Marilyn F. O'Grady, trailed far behind with 3 percent, or 198,000 votes. Aided by strong voter turnout, weak opposition and six years of relentless travel around the state, Mr. Schumer appeared to do well across the breadth of New York, winning majorities in rural, urban and suburban communities. He spent more than $13 million on his campaign, a large portion of which went to television and radio advertisements; he raised a total of $26 million for his campaign accounts, a huge amount that scared away many possible Republican challengers. Political strategists had said that it was unlikely that Mr. Schumer could outpoll Mr. Moynihan, if only because it has traditionally been easier for Irish or Italian Catholic candidates to draw cross-party votes upstate and in the suburbs. Mr. Schumer's triumph challenges the notion that a Jewish liberal Democrat from New York City would have trouble upstate and in the suburbs. Speaking to his supporters last night, Mr. Schumer said he felt honored by the size of his victory margin. ''Watching the returns roll in and reflecting on the past six years, I realized something tonight: it's more humbling to win by a lot than to win by a little,'' he said in his victory speech. ''When you win by a lot, it means that voters from all parts of the state, from every walk of life and from so many different philosophies and ideologies are putting their faith and trust in you. It is a huge responsibility.'' Despite Mr. Schumer's success, there was a sliver of good news for Mr. Schumer's main opponent, Mr. Mills, a three-term state legislator who gave up his seat in the Assembly to run. Mr. Mills, who phoned Mr. Schumer 20 minutes after the polls closed to concede defeat, managed a second-place finish, defying some predictions that he would fall to third place behind Dr. O'Grady. ''I congratulated him on his re-election to the United States Senate,'' Mr. Mills said in a concession speech to his supporters, drawing boos from the crowd, which he then sought to quiet. ''The senator was extremely gracious, for which I am grateful. I congratulate him and we wish him the best.'' For Dr. O'Grady, whose shoestring campaign drew interest if not votes, there was little to cheer, just a third-place drubbing. The Conservative Party had hoped to rattle the state Republicans and pull their leadership to the right, but in the end her poor showing may have undermined the Conservative Party's influence with Republican candidates in New York. During the campaign, Mr. Schumer said he was only focusing on serving in the Senate, but he has made it clear that his final decision about the future may rest on the outcome of the national vote. Should Democrats lose seats and influence in the Senate, Mr. Schumer might be more likely to run for governor in 2006, political strategists said. Over the course of his career in politics, which began when he was elected to the State Assembly when he was just 23 years old, Mr. Schumer has made it clear that he would like to serve as the state's chief executive. During his re-election bid, Mr. Schumer tried to bat away questions about his future, concerned that talk of running for governor might cut his margin of victory. Still, he could not bring himself to deny that he would run in two years. ''But I never say never,'' was how he responded when asked during one of two televised debates whether he would complete his second term. The day began early for the candidates. Mr. Mills went with his family to vote in Orange County, and Mr. Schumer went to vote at Public School 321 in Brooklyn. Before the results were clear, both sides tried to project a certain image yesterday -- Mr. Schumer one of hopeful uncertainty and Mr. Mills one of hope -- but they also gave away what they knew to be the likely outcome. By midday Mr. Schumer's aides were already planning a 15-county ''thank you'' tour, and Mr. Mills's aides had already contacted the Schumer campaign to ask how to phone the senator once the polls were closed. From the start, challenging Mr. Schumer, a popular incumbent, seemed an uphill battle. The state Republican Party struggled to find a candidate until Mr. Mills volunteered. In the end, the state party offered Mr. Mills moderate support, helped him broadcast some television advertisements upstate, and lent his campaign a Jeep to ride around New York. In the end, Mr. Mills said that at least he succeeded in getting to know party leaders around the state and, possibly, preparing for a future run for office. ''My friends,'' Mr. Mills said to his supporters last night, ''I can tell you this is not my last campaign.''

In this turbulent autumn her passion has been the defeat of President Bush. For the first time in their lives, she and her husband, Barrie, posted a sign for a candidate, Senator John Kerry, in their front yard. They donated money to the Democrats and Mr. Maguire, 65, even went door-to-door, shyly canvassing his neighbors for MoveOn.org, a group working to defeat Mr. Bush. On Tuesday morning, Mrs. Maguire, 57, tore Nov. 1 off her Spiritual Moments calendar and discovered that for Election Day she had chosen a quotation from Margaret Mead: ''Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world.'' ''I was like, 'Yes!''' Mrs. Maguire said. '''Karen, you were good!''' By the time the networks started calling states for the candidates on Tuesday night, Mrs. Maguire was on the edge of her seat. ''It was exciting before,'' she said. ''Now I'm scared.'' ''Oh God,'' groaned Mr. Maguire, when NBC raised the prospect that Florida might remain undecided overnight. In the cozy television room, Mrs. Maguire's piano and Mr. Maguire's banjo and guitar sat silent while all eyes focused on the screen. When Dan Rather of CBS called Pennsylvania for Mr. Kerry at 10:50 p.m., the Maguires issued a simultaneous ''Phew.'' Mrs. Maguire pressed her left hand to her chest. ''That's such a relief,'' she said. ''I want Ohio next.'' Like other enclaves of ''blue'' voters across the country, this tranquil pocket of old houses and older trees just outside Philadelphia was shaken into action by the Bush presidency. People who had voted regularly but never ventured deeper into politics organized telephone trees and door-knocking, and on Tuesday they made sure Kerry supporters voted. ''I've never felt sick about the possibility my man might lose the election, like I do this time,'' said Mr. Maguire, an artist who runs a Web site offering graphic art for newspaper op-ed pages. Mr. Maguire said he feared that the United States under Mr. Bush was becoming ''a warlike country.'' He feared that Mr. Bush's religion was shaping his policies. And, at perhaps a deeper level, Mr. Maguire feared that Mr. Bush's re-election would mean that he himself was out of step with his country, a concern that struck him after he returned from a trip to Ireland. ''I came back and I thought, 'Is America going to encourage the kind of behavior that Bush and his people have done?''' he said. ''And if so, where am I coming from? What's wrong with me?'' Like others here, the Maguires say they do not even talk politics anymore with relatives or neighbors who support Mr. Bush; the conversations become too angry. Some Democrats -- though not the Maguires -- said they could not understand why anyone would support the president. Down Chestnut Avenue from the Maguires, Karen Stern, the woman who recruited Mr. Maguire for MoveOn.org, was handling a neighbor's baby as she lined up volunteers for her telephone tree. Mrs. Stern's husband, Moss Stern, 42, was at a polling place gathering names of people who had voted. On evenings and weekends, when he is home from his job as an advertising copywriter and can care for their 2-year-old son, Mrs. Stern goes to work as the director of a nonprofit. She has been volunteering hours she does not have to defeat Mr. Bush. ''I'm so tired I felt like I was going to throw up this morning,'' she said. But she said that, beyond merely voting, she had to get more involved this year. ''I'm very, very scared for the future,'' she said. ''I don't want my kid to be drafted into the 10th war we're in by the time he's 18.'' As they left their polling place at the Church of the Evangel this afternoon, the Maguires encountered a knot of Bush supporters, including a neighbor, Paul Cobaugh, 58. Mr. Cobaugh, whose wife, Carol, is a Republican committee member, calls himself ''anti-Democrat'' and believes that ''the major players in the Democrat Party border on socialist.'' Standing on a golden carpet of fallen maple leaves, Mr. Maguire, the painter, and Mr. Cobaugh, a salesman of paint-related products, chatted about the new addition the Maguires were building on their house. The neighbors said not a word about the subject on everyone's mind.

Yes, they had already knocked on 9,796 doors. And yes, it was raining outside, a face-numbing blustery rain. But this was no time to rest, Brian Lundquist, a volunteer for President Bush here in Carver County, told a dozen bundled-up volunteer organizers gathered in an otherwise empty American Legion hall just after dawn on Election Day. ''We've got to get out there and do it all again,'' Mr. Lundquist declared. ''It won't mean anything if we don't win.'' So off raced the troops: Billy Cripe and his whole family, including his 14-month-old daughter, who rode in a knapsack on his back, marched through Chanhassen's subdivisions, knocked on doors, and hung leaflets about Mr. Bush on doorknobs -- sometimes on knobs that already held the very same brochure from some earlier marcher. On the other side of town, Sandy Johnson, who at 45 had never volunteered for a candidate before, spent the day at a desk with a phone, in a line of desks with phones, dialing likely Bush voters from Chanhassen, one after the last. Those who had not voted when she called before noon could expect a second call by dinner. In this swing state, one that was last captured by a Republican for president in 1972, Chanhassen is considered Republican turf. It is a reliably red blob inside a closely contested state, which meant on Tuesday that the town's Republicans fought with numbers and a sheer intensity and focus that even they acknowledged they had never witnessed before. ''I have never seen anything like what happened here,'' said Craig Peterson, as he, Mr. Lundquist and a crowd of other Republicans waited anxiously for answers from a large television set inside the High Timber Lounge here. ''Never before have you seen this many people, this much effort, this much here leading up to tonight.'' It is hardly as if Republicans had struggled here before. In 2000, when Mr. Bush lost Minnesota, he won Carver County with 59 percent of the vote to Al Gore's 35 percent. Still, this election season brought a new brand of fight and organization to Chanhassen, a mix, it seemed, of many ingredients: one town's small reflection of the passion felt across the country, the raw possibility that it might somehow sway the whole lump of Minnesota's 10 electoral votes into the Bush camp, and the memory of something truly rare for this city of 23,000 (13,583 of them registered voters) -- a visit in October from Mr. Bush himself. ''Since he came here, he's been like a local candidate to us,'' said Tom Furlong, mayor of Chanhassen, a fast-growing Minneapolis suburb. ''And I have to say, for everything we've heard about all the anger over this election, I don't see the anger here. I see only enthusiasm.'' Outside the polling station at City Hall, even the two women who sat alone, shivering in lawn chairs, with ''MoveOn.org'' signs said that they had been ''mostly ignored'' -- not taunted -- by voters as they passed, even though one city official had questioned whether the women were too close to the polling place. ''Voters here don't say a lot; they just look over at you and walk the other way,'' said Cathy Molenaar, a MoveOn volunteer and John Kerry supporter whose family moved here a few months ago. ''They're all just very Minnesota-nice about it.'' Perhaps, but even beneath so much Midwestern gentleness, small signs of tension seeped through by Tuesday evening. A sloppy, handmade cardboard sign sat in one Democrat's yard: ''Bush People Steal Signs. Vote Kerry.'' And in a Republican's yard, a handmade sign noted only what was absent: ''27 Bush Signs Stolen.'' Sandy Schmall, a Bush supporter, said that her daughter, Maddy, 6, had been reluctant to trick-or-treat in the yards of those with Kerry signs. Still, people here pledged to go on, either way. Inside the High Timber as the night wore on, Mr. Peterson said he was not sure what the campaign's intensity might mean once it was all over. ''Getting so many more people out to vote is tremendous, but I don't want politics to be divisive.'' Just after dawn on Wednesday, in the same hall where the Republicans made plans on Tuesday, some of the same faces would be back, along with some others. The Chanhassen Rotary Club has its weekly meeting here, as usual.

Or Kris Schultz, sitting behind a metal table in a bustling union office, shouting into cellphones as he directed squads of roving ''rapid response'' teams to specific addresses in an effort to squeeze every last vote out of Milwaukee's west side for Senator John Kerry. The story was much the same throughout the swing states in a race that produced some of the most extensive get-out-the-vote campaigns in memory. ''It's the biggest effort this state has ever seen, without question,'' said Jason Walsh, who was supervising Kerry volunteers at the Teamsters hall in St. Paul, Minn. ''People are incredibly energetic and enthusiastic. They really have the sense that this election could come down to a few hundred votes, and that those votes could be in Minnesota.'' As Mr. Walsh spoke, volunteers swarmed in and out of the hall, some grabbing apples or donuts along with their packets of leaflets. Organizers said more than 5,000 were working in the St. Paul area alone. Normally, such turnout efforts have been a Democratic specialty, and organizers in each of the swing states said this year's effort was the largest in the party's history. But Republicans said they, too, had put together the biggest efforts in their history and were confident they had matched or surpassed the Democratic push. Jayne Millerick, chairwoman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, said volunteers ''were in every county and just about every town in the state. I know that it's larger than anything we've ever done in the past.'' Both parties in New Hampshire said they had never mounted such an Election Day push. ''It's crazy, we've had so many people come out and volunteer,'' said Kathy Sullivan, chairwoman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. ''We've got people doing everything: working at polls, making phone calls, doing visibility on streets, going and actually knocking on doors. At 7 p.m. when some of the polls close, they'll start calling people in other parts of the state where polls are open till 8 p.m.'' Democrats in Minnesota as in other swing states had planned their Election Day operation in cooperation with advocacy groups, especially labor unions. The Republican Party, however, had to run its get-out-the vote operation, here and across the nation, almost exclusively by itself. ''Democrats have outsourced their registration and get-out-the-vote effort,'' said Eric Bearse, a spokesman for the Republican Victory Committee in Minneapolis. ''Our effort is generated by volunteers who have signed up the with Bush-Cheney campaign.'' Mr. Bearse said he expected Republican volunteers to make close to 400,000 contacts on Tuesday, both by phone and in person. ''We are conceding no region and no voter in the state,'' he said. Even before the sun came up over New Mexico's Sandia Mountains on Tuesday, party coordinators, voting activists and civic agitators of all stripes were preparing for the final onslaught in what has been a multimillion dollar effort to drive people to the polls. Representatives of America Coming Together, the voter mobilization group that planned to spend $10 million nationally on Election Day, sent more than 1,000 volunteers to neighborhoods from Espanola to Las Cruces. New Mexico Republicans had been working their get-out-the-vote effort throughout the weekend, said Whitney Cheshire, a party spokeswoman, who estimated the party had made more than 100,000 contacts. In Iowa, Louis E. Smith climbed into his 1993 Acura Legend at 6:30 a.m. and set off to burn some bridges with his former political party. A retired bureau chief in the Iowa Department of Education, Mr. Smith has been a registered Republican all his life. But the war in Iraq had made him a Kerry supporter, and even persuaded him to volunteer for the Democratic effort. ''I feel like I'm a bit of a traitor,'' Mr. Smith said. ''But I have to deal with principles. I just feel that the Republican Party headed by George Bush is calamitous.'' Republican officials said they were convinced that their get-out-the-vote effort in Iowa would be at least as good as the Democrats', with or without Mr. Smith. ''We're looking at our voter turnout efforts in key precincts and they have heavy turnout and are doing very, very well,'' said Dave Roederer, chairman of the Bush-Cheney campaign in the state. In Wisconsin, Democrats said they had more than 80,000 volunteers through the course of the campaign and 200 staffers on the ground, as well as nearly 3,000 ward captains in each of the state's key Democratic districts. ''These people took it block by block and house by house,'' said Josh Hamilton, press secretary for the Kerry campaign in Milwaukee. ''This was the most sophisticated and extensive get-out-the-vote effort that this state has ever seen.'' Republicans, too, put on the most extensive push in their party's history in Wisconsin. On Election Day alone, they said there were 10,000 volunteers making phone calls, checking on voting locations and urging sluggish voters to head to the polls. When some Republican wards were showing low voter turnout by midafternoon, phone banks were cranked up and the vote count was back to where the party wanted it within hours. Mr. Edirisinghe, a Sri Lankan who lived in Russia and Germany before settling more than a decade ago on Milwaukee's elegant north shore, was among them. He had begun volunteering for the Bush campaign six months ago and took five days off work so he could work full time in the final five days. He had met Mr. Wietbrock only a few minutes before the two of them headed out of the Bush campaign office in West Allis, Wis., to work through a list of voters. ''If it turns out Kerry wins Wisconsin, I'd feel terrible if I had done nothing for President Bush,'' Mr. Edirisinghe said. ''And I heard that my brother-in-law was volunteering for Kerry, so I had to do something to balance that out.'' In east Cleveland, there was palpable excitement in the pelting rain at a storefront, where about 50 Kerry workers gathered before dawn to fan out into the areas minority neighborhoods. ''This is turnaround time,'' said Willie Dunn, 36, who was canvassing for the advocacy group Acorn. ''It's vote or die.'' Fifteen miles away, from an office tucked discreetly behind a suburban strip mall in Brecksville, Republican organizers dispatched volunteers to voters committed to President Bush. ''I'm a runner,'' said Ken Kling, a 63-year-old manufacturers representative from Brecksville, south of Cleveland. ''I pick up vote sheets, the list of people who have voted, from the precincts, and bring them back here so we can call the ones who haven't voted.'' On the streets of Minneapolis and St. Paul, which are traditionally Democratic, as well as in several Republican suburbs, Democratic volunteers were more visible than Republicans. They were passing out leaflets, knocking on doors and waving signs. ''I have watched the excitement level go up to a total fever pitch,'' said Amie Shindelar, a Kerry volunteer. Asked to compare what Kerry volunteers were doing with the Bush effort, she said she couldn't. ''I have no idea what they're doing,'' Ms. Shindelar said. ''We are in our own bubble.''

''I want Bush out!'' she yelled across shady Huron Street before the workers, promoting Democratic candidates, could reach her. ''I already voted. I don't play around. This morning I was No.87.'' Ms. Roberts, who said she had checked the digital reader on the optical-scanning voting machine to see that hers was the 87th ballot cast at her precinct in Jacksonville on Tuesday, was just one of thousands of newly energized and mobilized blacks who voted here and across the country, including many in Florida who felt they had waited four years to have their votes counted at last. ''I'm satisfied,'' Ms. Roberts said. ''I saw my vote count.'' Nationwide, blacks went to the polls in large numbers and voted overwhelmingly for Senator John Kerry. They were prompted by vast get-out-the-vote drives, big increases in minority voter registration, new early voting periods and political passions kindled by issues from war to tax cuts. And still others saw themselves as part of a new crest in a civil rights struggle not yet complete four decades after federal voting rights laws were passed. ''I don't know why God chose Jacksonville to be a fighting ground, but this is about a movement,'' the Rev. R.L. Gundy told a group of voting rights workers crowded into a black church here on the eve of the election. ''It's not about abortion. It's not about gay rights. It's about human rights. It's about civil rights.'' Surveys by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International showed that nationally, blacks made up about 10 percent of voters at the polls. About 9 in 10 voted for Senator John Kerry, an overwhelming number that roughly mirrored the black turnout for Al Gore in 2000. The numbers for blacks appeared similar in Florida, where Election Day get-out-the-vote efforts in black neighborhoods sometimes found few people who needed getting out. ''A lot of people have already voted,'' said Maria Velazquez, a get-out-the-vote worker. To be sure, Florida and indeed much of the nation had fretted over the 2000 election. But for Jacksonville, a city aching to raise its national stature and recast itself as a culturally and economically sophisticated community, the lessons of 2000 included a reminder that it had not yet escaped its old Southern stratifications between blacks and whites. Four years ago, about 27,000 punch-card ballots were discarded here in Duval County, most because people had ''overvoted'' -- that is, voted for more than one candidate in the same race. About 40 percent of the ballots thrown out were cast in heavily black Democratic areas, a circumstance generating suspicion and accusations of racial bias that persisted until Tuesday. Some people here suggested that this Election Day could prove a measure of the city's ability to bridge its divides. ''The Super Bowl for football is in February,'' the interim Duval County elections supervisor, William Scheu, noting that the game would be played here in three months, said at a news conference on the eve of the election. ''The Super Bowl for our community coming together is tomorrow. And we hope and pray that will be the case.'' One crucial step toward easing tension may have been a technical one. In 2000, the names of presidential candidates were spread across two pages on the ballot, confusing some people who overvoted. But on Tuesday, with optical scanning, voters' ballots were instantly returned to them if they voted for two candidates in the same race. ''Overvotes can't happen,'' said Erin Moody, spokeswoman for the county elections office. Elsewhere across the country, the taint from 2000 may not have been as intense, but sentiment against President Bush was strong among blacks. In Pennsylvania, Dawn Hampton, 33, a temporary employee who works as an administrative assistant in North Philadelphia, said she felt misled by on the war in Iraq. ''Bush lied too much,'' Ms. Hampton said. ''I thought we were going in there because they had plans to kill us. They didn't find those weapons.'' She also took issue with the president on domestic issues. ''I thought he wanted to help everybody, talking about tax rebates the way he did,'' she said. ''It was all for the rich people.'' Keith Evans, a 34-year-old engineer with a large bakery in Philadelphia, said: ''Most black voters are going to respond to the loss of jobs. Look how many millions of jobs have been lost with Bush, how many jobs have been sent overseas. Companies are closing up. People don't have money to pay the bills.'' Some African-American voters in Cincinnati felt so passionate about the candidates and the issues in this election that many remained outside the polls for hours after voting. ''I could watch the results on TV,'' said Reginald Lucas, ''but I feel closer to things here.'' Denise Kelly, 45, said Senator Kerry offered the best plans for health care and job growth, the two issues she said most affected her family. ''I know too many people looking for jobs who are out of options,'' she said. ''The Republicans put them there. I want change.'' Al Cummings, a semiretired St. Louisian who said he tended to vote Democratic but did not do so exclusively, voted for Mr. Kerry on Tuesday because of the senator's positions on issues ranging from the war in Iraq to prescription drug costs. ''In fact,'' he said, ''I can't find one reason why one would vote for Bush.'' Though some polls had suggested that Mr. Bush might fare better with blacks, Ms. Roberts said the president had not earned their votes. Even as she praised the president for ''moral clarity,'' she dismissed the idea that Republicans could win black votes on the basis of social issues like abortion and same-sex marriage. ''That's not how you find them,'' Ms. Roberts said. ''You have to go into the community and talk to the people.''

With more than 95 percent of precincts reporting, President Bush was leading Senator John Kerry by a comfortable margin after a relatively trouble-free day at the polls. The United States Senate race here remained too close to call near midnight, with Mel Martinez, the Republican, leading Betty Castor, the Democrat, by just 14,000 votes. Mr. Bush, whose brother, Jeb Bush, is governor here, was doing especially well in Orange County, which Al Gore won in 2000, and elsewhere in swing-vote-rich Central Florida. As Mr. Bush pulled ahead by several hundred thousand votes, both parties turned their focus to the record number of absentee ballots requested here, with Democrats hoping their fervent promotion of absentee voting this year would give Mr. Kerry a late advantage. In a lawsuit filed late Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union asked that voters who received absentee ballots at the last minute get more time to mail them back. Officials in Broward County, one of the state's most populous and heavily Democratic, mailed thousands of replacement ballots as late as Saturday after the originals never reached their destination. Palm Beach County also mailed several thousand ballots Saturday, and postal officials warned it was dangerously late. ''These are people who applied for absentee ballots weeks ago and got them today,'' said Howard Simon, executive director of the A.C.L.U. of Florida. ''If they were denied an opportunity to vote through no fault of their own but more through the negligence of election officials, that's a pretty serious problem.'' A preliminary hearing in the suit, filed in federal court in Miami, was scheduled for Wednesday morning. Absentee ballots have traditionally benefited Republican candidates in Florida, where late-arriving ballots from overseas helped seal Mr. Bush's victory in 2000. But many Democrats, still wary of voting machinery after the electoral chaos of 2000, chose absentee ballots over voting in person this year. One high-ranking Democratic official said the party was confident that absentee ballots would help Mr. Kerry more than Mr. Bush, though Republicans were putting stock in them, too. Republican Party officials warned that due to the large number of absentee ballots this year, some counties would probably not finish counting them on Election Night. More than 250,000 absentee ballots were mailed out in Miami-Dade and Broward counties alone. ''If these are not counted tonight, we will seem far behind,'' Mindy Tucker Fletcher, a senior adviser to the Republican Party in Florida, wrote in an e-mail message to reporters. She said that Miami-Dade County, one of the state's most populous, might not finish counting tens of thousands of absentee ballots until Thursday, leaving the winner here in question if the race was tight. Ms. Tucker Fletcher also circulated a list of problems Republican poll watchers encountered in Broward County, which has the state's highest number of registered voters and is heavily Democratic. The police threw several Republican poll watchers out of precincts there, she wrote, while lawyers for the Kerry campaign harassed others. Earlier in the day, Republicans won a court order in Seminole County blocking Democrats from circulating a letter to Republican poll workers warning that they could be prosecuted for challenging legal voters. On Monday night, the Democratic National Committee left Republican poll workers an automated phone message with a similar warning. Hayden Dempsey, a chief lawyer for the Bush campaign in Florida, said, ''Now we have a judge saying the same thing we are -- that they are engaging in harassing tactics.'' Over all, though, neither side voiced major complaints about Election Day proceedings. Lawyers for both parties reported far fewer challenges of voter eligibility than expected. Long lines at polling places seemed the most widespread problem. ''There hasn't been any major meltdown,'' Mr. Dempsey said. But he added that the Republican Party sued the Leon County elections supervisor on Tuesday for allowing Kerry campaign workers to approach voters within 50 feet of polling places, which is prohibited by state law. Mr. Dempsey said the problem had been pervasive statewide but would not be the basis for any broad postelection legal challenge. Democratic Party officials, who say they had not been aggressive enough in challenging Mr. Bush's razor-thin victory here in 2000, said a more combative approach this year prevented Republicans from challenging the eligibility of thousands of voters around the state. Democrats said they had heard of only 13 eligibility challenges by late afternoon. ''In 2000 they disenfranchised voters and this is a push back on our part,'' said Mitchell Berger, a top lawyer for the Kerry campaign here who worked for Al Gore in the recount. State Senator Ron Klein, a Democrat from Boca Raton, said some Democrats had complained that the touch-screen machines they used registered them as voting for Mr. Bush even though they had selected Mr. Kerry. But he said most were able to fix the problem before it was too late. In a wider problem, Mr. Klein said, many Palm Beach County residents who requested but never received absentee ballots were having a hard time casting regular ballots at the polls. He said such people needed only to sign an oath swearing they had not yet voted, but poll workers were insisting on checking with the county election supervisor, whose phone lines were constantly busy. ''It's a fairly substantial number of people,'' he said. Under state law, absentee ballots must arrive in a county elections office by 7 p.m. on Election Day to be counted.

''I think what we've done is run a very honorable, clean campaign that has framed the important issues for the future of our country,'' Mr. Nader said. He said that his votes were taken as much from President Bush as from Senator John Kerry. For the last public appearance of his campaign, the 70-year-old Mr. Nader chose a public library basement in southeast Washington, where he complained that city officials wanted to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a new baseball stadium while the impoverished neighborhood lacked even a supermarket. ''Stadiums instead of libraries! Stadiums instead of school renovation!'' Mr. Nader thundered. He said he was wrapping up his presidential campaign with a local matter to highlight his insistence that the two major candidates had ignored such critical issues as the persistence of poverty. The stadium plans are a ''microcosm'' that ''show the distorted priorities of our public officials,'' he said. Late on Tuesday night, Mr. Nader went to the National Press Club, where 100 campaign workers and supporters in a subdued mood strolled among red, white and blue balloons. He vowed to challenge in court the ''dirty tricks'' of Democratic operatives who had tried to keep him off the ballot. ''It's a campaign where you can't lose if you define winning as getting more people into the political sphere and exposing the corruption and rot of the system,'' he said. Figures on Tuesday showed that Mr. Nader was barely making a dent, his vote too small to make a difference in all but a couple of states, Iowa and Nevada, of the nearly three dozen in which his name was on the ballot. In the major swing state of Ohio, Mr. Nader was not a factor at all because Democratic challenges resulted in his name being taken off the ballot in late September. Such challenges were the particular target of Mr. Nader's ire. ''I underestimated the mendacity of the Democratic Party,'' he said.

So he would be flipping channels late into Tuesday evening and again very early Wednesday morning to monitor coverage of the American presidential election on the wide, flat-screen television in his inner office at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, two senior French officials said. Mr. Chirac, who gets up at 6 a.m., was also expected to tune in to French radio, as he does every morning, an aide said. Mr. Chirac has access to an array of channels, including CNN and the BBC, although he usually tunes in French, watching without the sound throughout much of his day. Several French channels have all-night coverage of the American elections, including the all-news LCI. France 3 planned to broadcast from a studio where it had built a replica of the Oval Office. Among its guests: Richard C. Holbrooke, the former American representative to the United Nations, and Felix G. Rohatyn, the former American ambassador to France, both staunch Kerry supporters. From his hospital bed in the southwestern Paris suburb of Clamart, Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, was also watching American election coverage on television. ''There is no politician in the world who is not following the elections,'' Mr. Arafat's economic adviser, Mohamed Rashid, told Agence France-Presse. ''And Arafat is following them because those elections have a huge impact on our situation. He will respect and deal with any American president. He said, 'I am not for Bush or Kerry, I am for God.''' Mr. Chirac, meanwhile, has not expressed a preference for the American presidency, but the strained relationship between him and President Bush because of France's opposition to the American-led war in Iraq is well-known. Officials in Mr. Chirac's entourage say that they have prepared ''very rough drafts'' of congratulations depending on the outcome, although they confess they are not at all clear how a victory of either candidate would affect French-American relations. The most pressing foreign policy issue for whoever is elected president must be the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, said a senior French official close to Mr. Chirac. ''Our big question is, Will there be a decision by the American president to restart a dialogue?'' the official said. ''This is what we expect from the new president. This is the cause of a lot of the anti-Western feeling in the world.'' -------------------- Berlusconi Is Guest of Putin MOSCOW, Nov. 2 (Agence France-Presse) -- Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, and Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, both close allies and unabashed backers of President Bush, were together Tuesday in Russia, where they would watch the American election unfold and prepare a Russia-Italy summit. Mr. Berlusconi arrived in Moscow and was to travel to Mr. Putin's country residence in the forest outside the capital, where a person close to the Kremlin said the two men would ''certainly'' take a look at American election reports during an informal dinner.

On CBS, where Dan Rather proudly told viewers that ''I would rather be last than wrong,'' the most telling illustration on the electronic map was a big white splotch known as ''insufficient data.'' All the networks strained so hard to avoid repeating the early and flawed projections of 2000 that it was almost painful. Even though blogs and other Web sites on the Internet carried early voter survey results, the networks steered clear of even mentioning them. It was the wise, responsible thing to do (quite literally, politically correct), but it left the anchors without much to say. Like Kremlinologists studying the Politburo lined up at the Soviet May Day parade, viewers mostly had to squint and interpret clashing images of a tired President Bush returning to the White House lawn and an ebullient John Kerry feasting on chowder and clams at the Union Oyster House in Boston, and later, around 9:30, the president inviting television cameras into his residence to capture him surrounded by friends and family, with no corresponding sign of hospitality by his Democratic opponent. Fox News commentators cheered up after the president made his cameo appearance, but earlier they were quick to rush to conclusions, looking stunned and somber as they hinted that early voter surveys showed Mr. Kerry doing better than expected. ''I've spent all day telling Republican friends of mine that exit polls are usually right,'' William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, told Brit Hume just before 9 p.m. ''If the polls look bad, don't kid yourself.'' At that moment on ABC, Peter Jennings was reeling off a list of states and repeating, over and over as if taking the Fifth Amendment, ''We are not prepared to make a projection.'' Network caution was mocked on ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart'' on Comedy Central. When Mr. Stewart asked Stephen Colbert, a mock political analyst, for his prediction, Mr. Colbert demurred. ''I'm waiting for every vote to be counted, recounted, notarized and personally embossed.'' And the less networks could say, the showier their election night sets. CNN rented the Nasdaq site in Times Square. NBC outdid the competition by calling its flamboyant tent city of sky booths and control rooms outside Rockefeller Center ''Democracy Plaza,'' an Orwellian name that conjured Moscow's Chausse Entuziastov (Highway of the Enthusiastic). So did NBC's giant electoral map, carved into the ice of the Rockefeller skating rink and shown with aerial helicopter cameras; workers armed with spray cans painted Republican states red and Democratic ones blue -- but not precipitously. There were no daring predictions or even compelling election night features, though on ''The ABC Evening News,'' Peter Jennings did a self-flagellating segment on how the networks goofed in 2000, including a mea culpa montage of ABC and other network bosses raising their hands before a Congressional committee like chastened tobacco industry executives. Without much to see on the screen, it was hard not to notice the psychodramas playing out just beyond view. On NBC, Tom Brokaw was abdicating his throne, a bit wistfully, to the slick, shiny Brian Williams. And his retirement was mourned on the show. ''Can I just say Tom, Tom, Tom,'' Senator John McCain said. ''Could I just say on behalf of millions who watched you for so many campaigns, thanks for the memories.'' Mr. Brokaw and NBC's top political analyst, Tim Russert, sat cozily together at an anchor desk, with Mr. Russert scratching numbers on a lap-sized electronic board with red and blue markers -- a reprise of the memorable moment late in 2000 when he pulled out a grease board and scrawled a dozen undecided states and their electoral votes, to show how conceivable it was for the nation to have a deadlocked electoral college. Mr. Williams was instead isolated on a separate set, surrounded by high-tech maps and flashing electronic boards. It may have been meant to look like an anchorman bullpen where the rookie warms up, but it mostly looked as if Mr. Williams was an annoying cousin relegated to the children's table at Thanksgiving. Mr. Jennings, weary after many hours of anchoring his network's digital news station, ''ABC News Now,'' at times got almost giddy. Saying he was going to be ''a little bit naughty,'' he had his staff highlight Florida bright yellow to demonstrate what Mr. Kerry would need to win if Florida went for Mr. Bush. ''We are not calling it,'' he warned, as if worried viewers would mistake yellow for red. Dan Rather, who so famously misspoke in 2000 (''If we say somebody's carried the state, you can take that to the bank. Book it!'') mostly seemed at war with himself. He kept undermining somber restraint with his trademark over-the-top metaphors. At one point, he made a strained pop culture reference: ''We may need Billy Crystal to 'Analyze This' before it's all over.'' At another, he exclaimed, ''It don't mean a thing if they don't get those swing states.'' And that was the boldest prediction of the night.

President Bush seemed to hold a strong lead with 51 percent of the vote at 2 a.m., but Senator John Kerry's campaign refused to concede the state. ''It's been a long night, but we've waited four years for this victory,'' Senator John Edwards, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, said. ''We can wait one more night.'' Portending a Florida-like battle over each vote, Mr. Edwards said, ''John Kerry and I made a promise to the American people that in this election, every vote would count, every vote would be counted.'' Mr. Kerry's campaign manager, Mary Beth Cahill, sent an e-mail message to reporters about 1:30 a.m. saying that 250,000 votes had yet to be counted in Ohio. ''We believe when they are, John Kerry will win Ohio,'' she said. The uncertainty came at the end of a long day in which hundreds of thousands of voters waited in long lines, and polls were kept open well beyond closing times. The prospect of a drawn-out battle over provisional votes, absentee ballots and even a return to a recount of chads on punch-card voting machines loomed. As other states fell into familiar places, Ohio became the battleground of battlegrounds that it was billed to be throughout the election season. At the end of a long night of uncertainty, George Bush's issues and his ground game gave him a solid, if not quite decisive, lead. The candidates spent more time in the state than any other. Mr. Bush talked security, and Mr. Kerry hammered the economy. Mr. Bush sent an army of volunteers into suburban areas to turn out believers, and Mr. Kerry and his allies sent paid workers into the inner city to find new voters. In the end, both parties improved on their 2000 performance. Mr. Bush ran better in suburban areas in the southwest part of the state, and he picked up more votes in the rural areas that he had won decisively in 2000. Mr. Kerry reaped more votes than his strategists had hoped for in Cleveland, but did not get enough new voters in the big cities to overcome Mr. Bush's margins elsewhere. Democrats still hoped to overcome the lead and had begun to talk about provisional ballots, votes that are cast in the event of a dispute over registration. It was unclear how many provisional ballots were cast, but estimates ranged high enough to make a difference in the margin between the candidates. Turnout was strong everywhere. In spite of widespread rain and long lines, the secretary of state said turnout would be 5.8 million, or 73 percent, the highest since 1992. It was so heavy in parts of Columbus, Akron, Cleveland and even rural Knox County -- where hundreds of Kenyon College students waited six hours to vote -- that Democrats ordered volunteers to abandon phone banks and rush food, hot chocolate, chairs, umbrellas and radios to voters who had been waiting in the drenching rain. Republicans, who had proclaimed the superiority of their 72-hour strategy of intensive face-to-face contact in the last three days of the election, were deeply pleased with the results in their most important counties in the southwest part of the state and in the suburbs of Columbus. ''We've seen cases across the state where turnout may approach or even surpass records,'' said Jason Mauk, a spokesman for Ohio Republican Party. Even in the suburban areas of Cleveland, Republican turnout was high, party officials said. ''We had many precincts where we got every single one of our voters to vote,'' said Jeff Flint, a spokesman for the Cuyahoga County Republican Party. Democrats said their turnout strategy worked as well. ''In the major counties, we're hitting all our numbers,'' said Dan Trevas, a party spokesman. ''I can't figure out where the uncounted numbers are coming from.'' Mr. Kerry did extremely well in his political base in the Cleveland area, holding a lead of about 200,000 votes there, significantly better than Vice President Al Gore did in 2000. Mr. Kerry also performed well in Franklin County, which includes the state capital, Columbus. But the Democrats' improved performance in those two counties was not enough to close the gap with Mr. Bush, in large part because the Republicans squeezed additional votes out of their traditional political base in the northwest part of the state, the rural western border with Indiana and the conservative suburbs around Cincinnati, Republican strategists said. Many tiny rural counties, where Mr. Bush had won 65 percent or more of the vote in 2000, gave him even larger margins this year. Analysts attributed that improved turnout among conservatives in part to a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage that was on the ballot. ''The Republicans really galvanized their base with their get-out-the-vote operation, and they did so in large part by taking advantage of cultural issues that were important to Republicans voters,'' said Eric Rademacher, the director of the Ohio Poll at the University of Cincinnati. ''Clearly one of those issues was the constitutional amendment.'' Mr. Rademacher and other analysts said Mr. Bush's strong showing showed the Republicans had succeeded in moving the debate away from Mr. Kerry's strong suit: the weak economy and the high cost of health care. Early on Wednesday morning, Democrats declined to concede the race, arguing that there might be enough provisional ballots outstanding to tip the election to Mr. Kerry. Democrats contend, and many analysts agree, that the majority of those ballots were probably cast by Democrats, who tend to move more often than Republicans, and provisional ballots are more likely to be used by people whose addresses have changed. The question was: How many provisional ballots were cast? Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell estimated that the number might be between 130,000 and 150,000. But Democrats asserted it could be as high as 250,000. Provisional ballots are held for 10 days after the election while election workers determine whether the person who cast them is eligible to vote.

The measure, Amendment 36, would have meant that candidates, beginning with this election, would split the state's nine electoral votes, so that a candidate receiving, say, 33 percent of the popular vote would also get one-third of the Electoral College total, or three votes. But preliminary tallies late on Tuesday showed that two-thirds of voters rejected the proposal. Analysts said it was clear from the results that no core constituency had emerged to fight for the amendment. ''It never gained any traction,'' said Floyd Ciruli, an independent public policy researcher in Denver. From the outset, Amendment 36 was caught in the crosswinds of the presidential race in Colorado. By deciding to apply it immediately, the drafters had insured that voters would largely weigh the measure in terms of whether it would help or hurt one or another of the presidential candidates. But residents also divided on whether one state's going alone into Electoral College reform would be an act of visionary wisdom or of utter folly that would make Colorado a political backwater. Opponents of the measure, basing their calculations on past presidential voting , said a winner here would hardly ever receive more than five electoral votes under proportional distribution, while a loser would rarely get fewer than four. What that meant, they argued, was that the incentive for future national politicians to care about Colorado, with the stakes perhaps only one or two votes either way, would disappear. Supporters said that the system of electing presidents was broken and that leadership in changing it must start somewhere. Voters who supported the proposal also had to run against a tide of negative newspaper editorials across the state and the arguments of many elected officials, including Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican. Both major party candidates in the closely fought United States Senate race also opposed the amendment.

Voters in 10 of the 11 states with such initiatives on their ballots supported the amendments by wide margins. Gay-rights groups had expected to lose their battle at the ballot box and said the results were not surprising. ''We knew that we were underdogs in every state when we started out,'' said Matt Foreman, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. ''Putting a basic right up for a popular vote is always wrong and always extraordinarily difficult to win.'' Social conservatives were expectedly pleased, though they were preparing for the possibility that gay-rights groups could pull off a lone victory here in Oregon. ''I think it is a real warning shot across the bow of politicians, but also a warning shot across the bow to activist judges,'' said Gary Bauer, chairman of the Campaign for Working Families, a political action committee that supported the constitutional amendments. Surveys of voters leaving polling places showed wide margins of support for the measures among voters of all backgrounds: white and black, young and older, those with high incomes and low incomes. Conservatives and those who attend church regularly were particularly supportive; better-educated voters were less likely to be. In Michigan and Ohio, Democrats and liberals tended to vote against the proposition. But in Arkansas, those who identified themselves as Democrats and liberals tended to vote for the proposition. Utah voters approved the amendment overwhelmingly. And in Ohio, voters heavily backed an amendment known as Issue 1, a measure some Republicans had criticized as potentially curtailing the rights and benefits of unmarried heterosexual couples. Late Tuesday, 62 percent of voters were supporting the amendment, with 67 percent of precincts reporting. ''Congratulations to the people of the state of Ohio,'' said Phil Burress, chairman of the Ohio Campaign to Protect Marriage, one of the measure's chief advocates. ''They have defined marriage as between one man and one woman and also protected its benefits.'' The potential cliffhanger in what was otherwise sure to be a sweep for opponents of same-sex marriage was the outcome of the vote here in Oregon, where polls closed at 11 p.m. Eastern time. The initiatives on the ballot in 11 states have drawn intense interest from both sides of the debate over gay marriage, which was catapulted into the nation's political discourse when the highest court of Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriages there in a ruling in February. Gay rights groups have spent millions of dollars to defeat the state constitutional amendments, while opponents of same-sex marriage mobilized armies of supporters through the nation's churches. Before Tuesday, voters in Missouri and Louisiana had approved such amendments, although last month a Louisiana state judge threw out that vote, saying the amendment was flawed because it also had the effect of banning civil unions. Mr. Burress said his organization, working with 17,000 churches, had distributed 2.5 million inserts for church bulletins on Sunday. ''We've been trying to say this all along,'' Mr. Burress said earlier Tuesday. ''The church is going to show up today.'' Referring to Ohio's large Amish population, he said: ''The Amish are telling us they never registered before, but they are this time. They have no phones, so nobody's polling them or calling them. It's just an incredible thing.'' But the outcome in Oregon was much harder to call. An independent poll conducted last week for The Oregonian, the state's largest newspaper, showed voters split on the issue: 50 percent in favor of the amendment to 46 percent opposed. Gay rights groups have focused much attention in the state, where a combination of fiercely independent voters who often reject government interference in personal affairs and a large gay population seemed to give the groups a reason to hold out for a victory. Of the 11 states with ballot initiatives seeking to ban same-sex marriages, Oregon is the only one where thousands of gay couples were married last spring, mirroring similar marriages in San Francisco. The San Francisco unions were nullified in August, but the Oregon Supreme Court has yet to rule on the legal status of 3,000 gay couples married in Multnomah County, which includes Portland. Many married gay couples spent much of Tuesday following the returns on television and on Web sites. LeAnn Loche, 37, a graphic designer who lives in Portland and was married last March to her partner of nine years, described Election Day as gut-wrenching. ''I'm just a mess today,'' said Ms. Loche, a volunteer for the No on Constitutional Amendment 36 movement. ''It's the weirdest thing to have politics be so incredibly personal,'' she said. ''This is about the possibility that half of the state of Oregon thinks that I don't deserve to be treated equally as the majority of the people in the state. And I just can't fathom that, because I don't see myself as a monster.''

Kernan. Mr. Daniels, who also served in the Reagan White House and as a top executive at Eli Lilly & Company, deposed Mr. Kernan, who became governor in September 2003 after Gov. Frank O'Bannon died of a stroke. Mr. Kernan, a prisoner of war in Vietnam and the former mayor of South Bend, had made Mr. Daniels's service in the Bush White House a campaign issue, criticizing his opponent in speeches and advertisements. But he could not overcome Mr. Daniels's money or name recognition in a state won by Mr. Bush in 2000 and again this year. The national Republican party poured $2.6 million into the Indiana race on Mr. Daniels's behalf. Incumbent governors in Delaware, North Dakota, Vermont and North Carolina won re-election last night. The Democratic candidate in West Virginia kept the governor's office in the party's hands. Gov. Ruth Ann Minner of Delaware, a Democrat and the state's first female governor, held onto her office in an unexpectedly close race, while Gov. John Hoeven of North Dakota, a Republican, easily won a second term. Jim Douglas, the moderate Republican governor of Vermont who first won the office in 2002 after Gov. Howard Dean left the job to run for president, won another two-year term. He has held elective office in Vermont for most of the last 30 years. Michael Easley, the Democratic governor of North Carolina, also won re-election, keeping the seat in his party's hands, even as President Bush carried his state. He succeeded Jim Hunt, the popular Democrat who served two terms as governor in the 1990's. In West Virginia, Joseph Manchin, the secretary of state and long a familiar figure in state politics, will become the next governor. The office opened unexpectedly this year after the incumbent, Bob Wise, also a Democrat, admitted an extramarital affair and bowed out of the race. Eleven states were picking governors yesterday, five of them with no incumbent on the ballot. Before the elections, Republicans held 28 governors' offices and Democrats 22. Despite a number of competitive races this year and some probable party shifts, voting results and projections indicated that that overall balance of statehouse power would change by no more than one or two seats. The issues on which these races were decided were intensely local. Several states that went decisively for President Bush or Senator John Kerry appeared poised to elect a governor of the other party. Tight budgets and their effects on public services across the board were the main motivating factors for voters, although several states also presented candidates with sharply different styles and personal stories. There was no single marquee race for governor this year, but Indiana, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, Utah and Washington had closely fought contests. Races in Delaware, North Carolina, North Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia were less competitive by Election Day. Among the most closely-watched governors' elections was the race in Missouri, where the state auditor, Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, faced Matt Blunt, the Republican secretary of state and son of Representative Roy Blunt, the third-ranking Republican in the House. The race was close all fall. Ms. McCaskill defeated the incumbent, Bob Holden, in the Democratic primary. Ms. McCaskill and Mr. Blunt attacked each other's records and accused each other of changing positions. Ms. McCaskill would be the state's first female governor. Mr. Blunt generally hewed to Republican party positions, including opposition to some forms of stem cell research and support for a state constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. New Hampshire's incumbent governor, Craig Benson, was being challenged by John Lynch, a businessman who specializes in turning around troubled companies and who is a former chairman of the University of New Hampshire Board of Trustees. Mr. Benson, a wealthy technology entrepreneur, campaigned as a fiscal conservative, supporter of the death penalty and opponent of gay marriage. New Hampshire elects a governor every two years. The governor's race in Utah pitted two respected political families against each other in a race for an open seat, but the Republican prevailed in this reliably Republican state. John Huntsman Jr., the Republican scion of a wealthy chemical manufacturing family, a former ambassador to Singapore and a former deputy trade representative, defeated Scott Matheson, a Democrat from a prominent political family. Mr. Matheson is the son of a former governor and brother of a member of Congress from Utah, Jim. Like most other governor's races around the nation, the debate focused on jobs and the economy. Governor Minner, 69, who rose to the state's top office from an impoverished background, is a fiscal conservative but a moderate on social issues. Among her first acts on taking office in 2001 was to order broad cuts in state spending. She has tried to improve the state's health programs and helped push through a tough ban on indoor smoking. She has also tried to limit the expansion of gambling in Delaware. She defeated Bill Lee, 68, a Republican who is former Superior Court judge. In North Dakota, Governor Hoeven, a former banker and a onetime Democrat, won the office as a Republican in 2000 in his first political campaign. This year he pointed to improvements in the state economy, including a modest increase in employment and incomes in the state. Mr. Douglas, the Republican who was re-elected governor of Vermont, has engaged in virtually nonstop campaigning for the past 25 years. He served 12 years as secretary of state and 8 years as treasurer before winning the governor's office in 2002. His Democratic opponent, Peter Clavelle, first won office as a Progressive, becoming the mayor of left-leaning Burlington in 1989. He was defeated four year later by a Republican, then won back the office in 1995Mr. Manchin, West Virginia's new governor, defeated Monty Warner, a Republican who is a former Army officer and is now a real estate developer. Mr. Manchin served in both houses of the state legislature and as secretary of state. He managed to unite business and labor interests and has talked about making the state more attractive to businesses and tourists. Two other incumbents, Judy Martz of Montana, Republican, and Gary Locke of Washington, a Democrat, also choose not to seek re-election.The Democratic candidate in Montana, Brian Schweitzer, and the Republican, Secretary of State Bob Brown, traded accusations of unethical conduct throughout the fall.

In addition to the gains achieved in Texas under a disputed redistricting plan, Republicans picked up a seat in Kentucky and successfully defended most of their threatened incumbents. Democrats turned out some Republicans as well, including Representative Philip M. Crane of Illinois, the longest-serving Republican in the House, who lost to a Democratic businesswoman, Melissa Bean. In Georgia, Max Burns, a freshman Republican, lost to John Barrow, a Democratic county commissioner. But the Republican-engineered redistricting in Texas provided a strong buffer against those losses, with returns compiled by The Associated Press showing that most of the five Democratic incumbents thrust into new districts there would not survive. At midnight, Representative Thomas M. Reynolds of New York, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said he was confident his party would again control the speaker's gavel. ''It's been a good night for us so far,'' Mr. Reynolds said. ''Despite Democrats' claims to the contrary, Republicans will be in the majority in the 109th Congress. The only thing left to determine is how big our majority will be.'' Among the Democrats defeated in Texas was Representative Martin Frost, a former party leader known for his political skills, who lost to Representative Pete Sessions, a Republican. In another Texas contest pitting two incumbents, Representative Charles W. Stenholm, a leading Democratic voice on fiscal issues, lost to Representative Randy Neugebauer. Democrats needed a net gain of 12 seats to end Republican control of the House, and with most incumbent lawmakers running without competitive opposition, that was a formidable task. A vast majority of incumbents were easily re-elected. In Kentucky, Democrats lost a seat when Nick Clooney, a former television newscaster who is the father of the actor George Clooney, was defeated by a Republican, Geoff Davis, returns compiled by The A.P. indicated. The seat is now held by Representative Ken Lucas, a Democrat, who is retiring. Anne M. Northup, a Kentucky Republican whose seat the Democrats had believed was vulnerable, won handily, defeating her Democratic challenger, Tony Miller. Democratic leaders had poured time and money into those contests in Kentucky as part of their strategy to recapture the House. Connie Mack, the son of the former senator with the same name, held the Republican seat in southwest Florida that was vacated this year when Porter J. Goss became director of central intelligence. Several prominent Florida lawmakers were re-elected, including Representative C.W. Bill Young, a Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Some prominent lawmakers won re-election in Ohio as well, among them Michael Oxley, chairman of the Financial Services Committee, and Bob Ney, chairman of the Committee on House Administration, both Republicans, and Dennis J. Kucinich, the last Democratic presidential candidate to keep campaigning against Senator John Kerry. In Illinois, Daniel Lipinski, a Democrat, was elected to replace his father, William, who retired. But in a race for a vacant seat in Virginia that Democrats had hoped to win, Thelma Drake, a Republican member of the state's House of Delegates, defeated the Democrat, David Ashe, a former Marine officer and veteran of the war in Iraq. The seat is in the Tidewater area, which has a concentration of naval bases and retirees from the Navy. Representative Edward L. Schrock, a Republican, is retiring there. The House has become an especially partisan institution in recent years, and the party in control has managed to develop legislation without real consultation with the opposition. For the last 10 years, this has been frustrating for Democrats, who, except for a brief break in the 1950's, ran the House from the 1930's through 1994. Not all the races for Congress are finished, because those in some Louisiana districts are headed for runoffs in December. But Bobby Jindal, who lost a runoff for governor last year, won outright yesterday in a suburban New Orleans district. He is a former federal health official and a son of Indian immigrants. In trying to hold on to the House, Republicans had a big advantage, given the scarcity of truly competitive races and the Congressional redistricting in Texas that put a half-dozen Democratic seats in jeopardy in that state alone. That redistricting by the State Legislature brought months of political acrimony. Democratic lawmakers fled the state for a time to deny the Republican majority a quorum and so temporarily block the redrawing of the lines, and the new map was challenged all the way to the Supreme Court. The justices, in a decision that effectively kept the new districts in place for this election, sent the matter back to a lower court last month for review. Five Democratic incumbents ultimately chose to run in their new Texas districts, but just one was given a better-than-even chance of retaining his seat. All told, Republicans hoped to gain as many as seven seats in Texas, offsetting possible Northeastern and Midwestern gains by Democrats in districts with large numbers of Democratic voters where moderate Republicans held seats. Democrats took aim at incumbents and open seats in areas where they believed President Bush's popularity was lagging, including Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois, Minnesota and urban districts in and around Louisville, Ky., and Albuquerque. In a handful of districts, they ran advertisements tying the incumbents to Mr. Bush and his administration's policies on health care and the economy. The idea was to halt ticket splitting by voters who were opposed to Mr. Bush but might be inclined to back their local member of Congress.

Ms. Murkowski, who was appointed to the Senate after her father was elected governor of Alaska in 2002, contended with accusations that she got her job by way of nepotism. Mr. Knowles, governor from 1994 to 2002, emphasized his willingness to break from the national Democratic Party, particularly on issues involving development. For instance, Mr. Knowles, like Ms. Murkowski, supports opening the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve for oil exploration, despite his party's staunch opposition to the proposal. ARIZONA President Bush won Arizona's 10 electoral votes, and Senator John McCain, the Republican, easily won a fourth term over Stuart Starky, an eighth-grade math teacher. Mr. Starky was never given much chance of defeating Mr. McCain. While expressing personal admiration for Mr. McCain, Mr. Starky said his opponent was more interested in gaining national popularity than in serving Arizonans. Voters also approved a measure to tighten immigrant controls in a state with a large Hispanic population. It requires proof of citizenship to register to vote, photo identification to vote and proof of eligibility to receive local welfare benefits. Another measure that was approved requires anyone proposing a public initiative to specify a financing source other than the state's general fund. CALIFORNIA Senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat, held onto her seat with a sweeping victory over the Republican candidate, Bill Jones, a former secretary of state. Even in this solidly blue state, the two-term senator is often viewed as being more liberal than most Californians, but according to voter surveys, she did well in all parts of the states. As with her Republican opponents in the past, Ms. Boxer outspent her challenger by millions of dollars. Voters seemed poised to approve the most controversial ballot measure, which would allow for a $3 billion bond sale over the next decade to create the largest state-financed embryonic stem cell research program in the nation. Sixty percent of voters favored the measure, with 14 percent of the precincts reporting. COLORADO Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell's decision to retire gave Democrats a chance to pick up a Republican-held Senate seat, and with most of the vote counted, Ken Salazar, the Democratic state attorney general, was running narrowly ahead of Pete Coors, chairman of the beer company that bears his family name. Mr. Salazar's popularity helped Senator Kerry run better than expected, though President Bush carried the state by a safe margin. Only one change was certain in the House delegation, a replacement for Scott McInnis, a six-term Republican, who is retiring. With more than half the votes counted, Greg Walcher, a Republican state official, was narrowly leading Mr. Salazar's brother John, a Democratic state senator. Voters rejected a measure to change the state Constitution to allocate Colorado's nine electoral votes based on the popular vote, rather than winner-take-all. HAWAII In seeking an eighth term, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, a Democrat who turned 80 two months ago, encountered little trouble against Cam Cavasso, a Republican and a former state representative. Mr. Kerry held a firm lead over Mr. Bush, and polls suggested that Representatives Neil Abercrombie and Ed Case, both Democrats, would be re-elected. IDAHO This Republican state sent its incumbent senator and two Republican representatives back to Congress and gave its electoral votes to President Bush. Senator Michael D. Crapo was opposed by Scott McClure, a Democratic write-in candidate. Nicole LeFavour was poised to become the first openly gay member of Idaho's Legislature. She was leading her Republican opponent by 30 percentage points in partial results. MONTANA For the first time in 16 years, a Democrat was elected governor of Montana, as Brian Schweitzer defeated Republican Bob Brown. The two were competing for the office held by Gov. Judy Martz, a Republican, who decided not to seek re-election. Mr. Schweitzer narrowly lost a bid for the Senate in 2000. In the days before the election, his campaign worried about the impact a large turnout for President Bush would have, because presidential candidates have long coattails in Montana. Not in this case, it turned out. NEVADA Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat and the minority whip, easily defeated his Republican challenger, Richard Ziser, a Las Vegas businessman. Mr. Ziser, who was running for political office for the first time, helped campaign for Nevada's constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage and had hoped to use that network of voters to rally conservatives. In the state's House races, Shelley Berkley and Jim Gibbons, the incumbents, coasted to victory. Jon Porter, the other incumbent, led his opponent with 11 percent of the precincts reporting. With both presidential candidates campaigning hard for the state, surveys of voters showed Senator Kerry with a slight edge. Many singled out his promise to block a proposal to build a nuclear waste dump northwest of Las Vegas as an important issue. President Bush had approved the plan. With 17 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Kerry had a small lead in the actual vote. NEW MEXICO The campaigns of President Bush and Senator Kerry made immense efforts to win this state, which President Bush lost by 366 votes in 2000. Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat whose mother was born in Mexico, helped round up support for Mr. Kerry, especially among Hispanic voters. Mr. Bush also made overtures to Hispanics, who account for 42 percent of the state's population. In the Albuquerque metropolitan area, Representative Heather A. Wilson, a former Air Force officer and frequent spokeswoman for the Republicans on military issues, faced a strong challenge from State Senator Richard Romero, a Democrat who is a former schoolteacher. OREGON Senator Kerry defeated President Bush in Oregon, which has the country's only all-mail-in balloting system. Leading up to the election, Republicans had hoped that a ballot measure to ban same-sex marriage would draw out the state's conservative voters. That measure passed, while voters rejected a measure to expand the state's medical marijuana law. In one of the country's most costly and contentious Congressional races, Representative David Wu, a Democrat, held onto his seat, defeating Goli Ameri, a Republican. The race centered on foreign and economic policy until recent weeks, when reports surfaced that a former girlfriend had accused Mr. Wu of sexual assault when they were in college. Representative Darlene Hooley, a Democrat, fought back a challenge by Jim Zupancic, who accused her of being too liberal to represent her Republican-leaning district. With 69 percent of precincts reporting, Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat, seemed poised for re-election. UTAH Jon Huntsman Jr., a Republican, held a wide lead over Scott Matheson, a Democrat, in early returns in the race for governor. Neither candidate holds elected office, but they have two of the state's best-known names. Mr. Huntsman is a former ambassador who heads the chemical company in Salt Lake City that bears his family's name. Mr. Matheson, a former United States attorney, is the son of a former governor, and the brother of a congressman. The two ran fairly staid campaigns, though late Democratic advertisements called Mr. Huntsman a polluter. Senator Robert F. Bennett, a Republican, was comfortably ahead of former state attorney general, Paul Van Dam, a Democrat, in early returns. Voters also gave overwhelming approval to a ban on same-sex marriage. WASHINGTON With the polls closing at 11 p.m. Eastern time, complete results were not immediately available, but Senator Kerry appeared to have an early edge with a quarter of the precincts reporting. Senator Patty Murray, a former preschool teacher and a two-term Democrat, was favored against Representative George Nethercutt, who in 1994 defeated Representative Tom Foley, the speaker of the House. In the governor's race, the Democrat, Christine Gregoire, the three-term attorney general, was favored over Dino Rossi, a Republican former chairman of the State Senate Budget Committee. Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat, did not run. Voters rejected a 1 percent sales tax increase for education and a move to overturn the charter schools law, but approved a ban on dumping nuclear waste and a change in the primary system so that the top two vote-getters in primaries would advance to the general election. WYOMING Wyoming had a quiet political year. It was not a presidential swing state, and the Senate seats and governor's office were not on the ballot. Voters decided on two ballot measures to curb medical malpractice judgments, but with most precincts reporting, the contests were too close to call.", "title": "THE 2004 ELECTIONS: STATE BY STATE -- West; Shades of 2000: For the most part, the red states stay red and blue states stay blue."}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/Mexico", "Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/United States", "Top/News/U.S.", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Alaska", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Arizona", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/California", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Colorado", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Hawaii", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Idaho", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Montana", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Nevada", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/New Mexico", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Utah", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Washington", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Wyoming", "Top/News/U.S./Northwest", "Top/News/U.S./Rockies", "Top/News/U.S./Southwest", "Top/News/U.S./West", "Top/News", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Alaska", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Arizona", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/California", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Colorado", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Hawaii", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Idaho", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Montana", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Nevada", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/New Mexico", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Oregon", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Utah", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Washington", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Wyoming", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Idaho", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Oregon", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Colorado", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Arizona", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Wyoming", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Utah", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Washington", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Alaska", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Montana", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Hawaii", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Nevada", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/California", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/New Mexico"], "publication_day_of_month": "3", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "U.S.", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "National Desk", "print_page_number": "13", "print_section": "P", "publication_day_of_week": "Wednesday", "print_column": "1", "slug": "03SBAL$02"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "ILLINOIS The Democrats gained a Senate seat in Illinois, as the bright young star of the Democratic Party, Barack Obama, won convincingly. Mr. Obama, 43, gained national attention in Boston at the Democratic National Convention, delivering a keynote address that was widely praised by members of his party. Mr. Obama was facing Alan Keyes, 54, who joined the race late, after another Republican, Jack Ryan, dropped out when embarrassing allegations were raised in his divorce papers. The candidates were competing to replace Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald, a Republican, who is retiring. INDIANA President Bush captured Indiana's 11 electoral votes and helped propel Mitch Daniels, his former director of the Office of Management and Budget, into the governor's mansion. Mr. Daniels, who had 54 percent of the vote with more than 90 percent of the state's precincts reporting, defeated the incumbent Democrat, Joseph E. Kernan, who took office last year after the sudden death of Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon. Senator Evan Bayh, a fiscally conservative Democrat who accumulated a $7 million campaign war chest, easily defeated Marvin Scott, a sociology professor who was a featured speaker at the Republican National Convention. John Hostettler, the Republican congressman who grabbed headlines this year when he was caught with a loaded gun at an airport checkpoint, emerged victorious over Jon Jennings, a Democrat, in a district known for tight races. Julia Carson, the Democrat who represents the Seventh District in the House, held on to her seat, but her fellow Democratic incumbent, Baron P. Hill, was in a dead heat in his race against Mike Sodrel, his Republican challenger. IOWA Charles E. Grassley, a Republican, won a fifth term in the Senate, easily defeating the Democratic challenger, Arthur Small, a lawyer and former state legislator. Mr. Grassley, who shapes the nation's tax laws as chairman of the Finance Committee, won about two-thirds of the vote, as he did in 1992 and 1998. The state's five House members also won re-election. Iowa, which has only seven electoral votes, was a favorite destination for President Bush and Senator Kerry in the final days of the presidential race. Mr. Bush lost Iowa by less than half a percentage point in 2000, and he tried to win it this year by focusing on counties that he had lost to Al Gore. Mr. Kerry's victory in the Iowa caucuses in January set him on the path to the Democratic presidential nomination, and he returned often, hoping Iowa would give him the margin to win the White House. KANSAS Senator Sam Brownback, a Republican, won re-election by an overwhelming margin. National and state Republican leaders were again hoping to defeat Representative Dennis Moore, the Democrat in the Third District who has been an anomaly in this solidly Republican state. But Mr. Moore, the only Democrat in the Congressional delegation, defeated Kris Kobach, a law professor and former Justice Department official. In a race that proved closer than initially forecast several months ago, Representative Jim Ryun, the former Olympic middle-distance runner and a Republican, beat his Democratic challenger, Nancy Boyda, a political unknown who worked in the pharmaceutical industry and waged a hard-fought campaign. MICHIGAN With 60 percent of precincts reporting last night, Senator Kerry was poised to win a slim victory in Michigan, thanks to strong support from unions, first-time voters and dominant concerns about the economy. With neither its Democratic governor nor its two Democratic senators up for re-election and no House seats expected to switch parties, the major campaigns in Michigan involved ballot proposals to ban same-sex marriage and limit Indian gambling. The gay-marriage ban, known as Proposal 2, passed with 60 percent of voter support. The gambling proposal also passed with 60 percent support. MINNESOTA Senator Kerry was leading in the race for Minnesota's 10 electoral votes. With no Senate seat up for grabs, no race for governor and a series of Congressional races where the incumbents all held their seats, the focus was on which way the state would vote for president. Although Bill Clinton won the state by a wide margin in 1996, Al Gore barely took it in 2000, winning by two percentage points. MISSOURI In one of the country's most hotly contested governor's races, Secretary of State Matt Blunt held a slight edge over State Auditor Claire McCaskill with about 80 percent of the state's precincts counted. Ms. McCaskill, 51, who boasts a long political r\u00e9sum\u00e9, wrested the Democratic nomination away from the incumbent, Bob Holden. Mr. Blunt is just 33 but comes from a three-generation political family. His father, Representative Roy Blunt, the third-ranking House Republican, won his re-election race easily. Senator Christopher S. Bond, the three-term Republican incumbent, defeated State Treasurer Nancy Farmer. The departure of Representatives Richard A. Gephardt and Karen McCarthy, both Democrats, left two open Congressional seats. For Ms. McCarthy's seat, the Democrat, Emanuel Cleaver, a former Kansas City mayor, defeated the Republican, Jeanne Patterson, a political newcomer. In the race for Mr. Gephardt's seat, Russ Carnahan, the son of former Senator Jean Carnahan and the late Gov. Mel Carnahan, was leading his Republican opponent, Bill Federer. NEBRASKA President Bush was leading in this staunchly Republican state, garnering two-thirds of the vote with roughly half of the precincts reporting. Jeff Fortenberry, the publishing executive who was the Republican candidate for the House seat vacated by Doug Bereuter, beat the Democrat, State Senator Matt Connealy. NORTH DAKOTA President Bush trounced Senator Kerry in North Dakota, winning more than 60 percent of the vote. Senator Byron Dorgan, a Democrat, retained his seat, easily dispatching his Republican opponent, Mike Liffrig, a lawyer who had tried to make an issue of Mr. Dorgan's brief appearance in the controversial documentary ''Fahrenheit 9/11.'' Another Democrat, Representative Earl Pomeroy, overcame a challenge from Duane Sand, a Republican. Gov. John Hoeven, a Democrat-turned-Republican, steamrolled over his Democratic opponent, Joe Satrom, a former state senator. Mr. Hoeven had to overcome the anger of traditionally conservative members of hunting groups who objected to the governor's decision to change the pheasant hunting season. Measure 1, a constitutional amendment that defines marriage as legal only when between a man and a woman and does not recognize any other type of domestic union, won wide support from voters. OHIO Ohio and its 20 electoral votes were proving critical in the presidential race, but it was still too close to call early Wednesday despite a small edge for President Bush. In a statewide race, Sen. George V. Voinovich, a Republican who had also served as governor and mayor of Cleveland, won a second term with an easy victory over Eric Fingerhut, a Democratic state senator. Mr. Voinovich had held strong leads in the polls and a huge advantage in money. Ohioans also voted strongly in favor of a state constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriages. Ohio was one of 11 states with the issue on the ballot, but its version was tougher: The state also sought to rule out civil unions. The measures on the ballot were considered a potential boost for Mr. Bush. But the proportion of the ''no'' vote that went for Senator Kerry was greater than the proportion of the ''yes'' vote that went to Mr. Bush. Opponents of the measure promised to consider a legal challenge. SOUTH DAKOTA In a race that could throw out the most powerful Democrat in the Senate, the former Representative John Thune was locked in a near-dead heat against Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader. Mr. Thune had 51 percent of the vote and Mr. Daschle had 49 percent, with 81 percent of the precincts reporting. Mr. Daschle, who has represented South Dakota on Capitol Hill since 1978, was elected party leader in 1994. Critics, including Mr. Thune, say Mr. Daschle is more closely aligned with the national Democratic Party than the state. Since leaving the House, Mr. Thune has headed a lobbying group in Washington, which has prompted some to say that he is just as tied to Washington as Mr. Daschle. When Mr. Thune ran against Senator Tim Johnson in 2002, Mr. Johnson won by only 524 votes. President Bush easily won the state, as he did in 2000. Analysts had said the outcome of the Senate race could be determined by who showed up at the polls for the presidential election. WISCONSIN In Wisconsin, where Al Gore narrowly defeated George W. Bush in 2000, there was no decisive winner as of last night. The state was the scene of fierce campaigning, and with 75 percent of precincts reporting, the presidential race was neck and neck. Also with 75 percent of the precincts reporting, Senator Russell D. Feingold, a Democrat perhaps best known for championing campaign finance reform, was leading, with 56 percent of the vote in his race against Tim Michels, a construction company executive and former Army ranger who ran as a Republican. The candidates clashed over a host of issues, including the war in Iraq and antiterrorism legislation, which Mr. Feingold was the lone senator to vote against, saying he feared that it would infringe on civil liberties. The state's incumbent representatives, four Republicans and three Democrats, were re-elected. Gwen Moore, a Democrat, won the one open seat.", "title": "THE 2004 ELECTIONS: STATE BY STATE -- Midwest; In a region sharply divided, Ohio and Wisconsin went down to the wire."}, "meta": {"taxonomic_classes": ["Top/News/World/Countries and Territories/United States", "Top/News/U.S.", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Illinois", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Iowa", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Kansas", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Michigan", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Minnesota", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Missouri", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Nebraska", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Ohio", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Wisconsin", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/Indiana", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/North Dakota", "Top/News/U.S./U.S. States, Territories and Possessions/South Dakota", "Top/News/U.S./Midwest", "Top/News/U.S./Plains", "Top/News", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Illinois", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Indiana", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Iowa", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Kansas", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Michigan", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Minnesota", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Missouri", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Nebraska", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/North Dakota", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Ohio", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/South Dakota", "Top/News/Washington/Campaign 2004/States/Wisconsin", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Michigan", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Iowa", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Kansas", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Illinois", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Ohio", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Indiana", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Nebraska", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/North Dakota", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Wisconsin", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Missouri", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/South Dakota", "Top/Features/Travel/Guides/Destinations/North America/United States/Minnesota"], "publication_day_of_month": "3", "publication_year": "2004", "online_sections": "U.S.", "publication_month": "11", "dsk": "National Desk", "print_page_number": "13", "print_section": "P", "publication_day_of_week": "Wednesday", "print_column": "1", "slug": "03SBIL$01"}}, {"body": {"body_text": "The American people know what to do in these situations: a painfully close division in the Electoral College, and at least one large state with a big pile of disputed ballots. We wait for the best possible count, ready to accept whoever wins by the rules of the game as the next chief executive. When a victor is finally, officially announced, it is important for the entire country to accept him as the rightful president. We have had enough of rancor for a while, and our greatest hope now is that the next president will earn the right to be seen as leader by all the nation. It was inspiring yesterday morning to see the lines of voters at the polls around the nation, but the mood was worrisome. Party loyalty was not the overarching emotion this year. Neither was enthusiasm for either of the candidates. The main emotion seemed to be contempt for the other side. The country has been battered by war, fear of terrorism and economic uncertainty -- all of which seem to have intensified the longstanding distrust between the more secular, urban regions and the religious, rural areas. Three years ago, the trauma of Sept. 11 brought us together. But as we have noted again and again, President Bush failed to come up with a national agenda that would make that moment of strong national purpose permanent. The knee-jerk partisanship that replaced it has been made worse by the narrow division between Republicans and Democrats, which makes everyone in Washington feel compelled to jockey for the slightest partisan advantage. If he is going to succeed at achieving anything of substance, the next president will have to help the nation reach some new place where elected officials expect that rewards can be won from cooperation and mutual respect. Right now, we are in the peculiar position of suffering political paralysis, despite the fact that there is a clear consensus on most questions of policy. Any pollster, and any reasonable politician, can tell you what most Americans want, particularly when it comes to a domestic agenda. Pick the moderate position on almost any issue -- Social Security, gay rights, taxes -- and you will find the public right behind you. But lawmakers can't lead themselves into a bipartisan consensus. Only a president can create a new mood, and he can do it only by sacrificing his own short-term political advantage on occasion for the common good. The next chief executive will also have to reckon with the failure of both parties this year to prepare the American people for bad news or common sacrifice. For all their disagreements about the war, both George Bush and John Kerry assured the public that Iraq can be stabilized and moved toward a semblance of democratic government, and that American troops will stay until that happens. That job will be tougher, bloodier and more expensive than either candidate has been willing to admit. Neither man has actually suggested that any voters (other than Mr. Kerry's Very Wealthy) will have to sacrifice anything to underwrite the cost of staying in Iraq indefinitely. And neither man has come close to preparing Americans for the possibility that the next president may have to admit that fixing the mess in Iraq has become not merely a question of what Americans can accomplish, but a losing game in which the United States is doing its global interests more harm than good. And neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Kerry has been forthright about the challenges of a world where American workers are going to have to be very adaptable, and American children much better educated, to compete with the ambitious and energetic next generation in places like China and India. Neither has done a particularly convincing job of explaining how Americans can expect to continue getting all the government services they have reason to expect, while the government still finds money for new challenges like homeland security. The new president, in truth, faces a nearly impossible job, and it is a tribute to the optimism of the human spirit that at the beginning of this year, so many people were vying to take on this task. We entered this election season discouraged, as usual, by the caliber of the candidates running for president. As time went on, we were forced to admit -- perhaps a little grudgingly -- that Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry shared the steely discipline and self-possession that are critical requirements for the most difficult job on the planet. As the votes were slowly counted last night, we hoped for clarity and fairness in the ultimate result. But most of all, we hoped that the ultimate winner would balance his enormous self-confidence with a large dose of humility. That could mark the beginning of a White House for all the people.

The election, cast as it was between competing visions of how the United States should be in the world, has only intensified the psychic pull: away, over there. Meanwhile, here at home, another force has gained momentum, resulting in a growing number of working families who have been derailed by a relentlessly slack job market, stagnant wages and out-of-control health care costs. The New York City economy started to come back to life within a year of 9/11. But since then, the benefits of economic growth have, perversely, flowed up the income scale, creating buyers for ''average'' million-dollar apartments and sushi dinners for $350 per person. Meanwhile, 20 percent of residents live below the poverty line -- barely $18,000 for a family of four -- and two-thirds of those in poverty work for an average hourly wage of $6.77, far too meager to meet their basic needs. Economic despair leads to social and spiritual crises, as seen in soup kitchens and homeless shelters that are strained beyond capacity and families racked by discord and deprivation. Those most in need are single mothers, who head 24 percent of the families in New York City, and low-income families who have been struck by disaster in any of its unwelcome forms. Once someone's down, it is hard to come back: according to a recent survey, the biggest problem facing New Yorkers is simply finding and keeping a job. To make it through trying times, the neediest New Yorkers need the help of their fellow New Yorkers. A proven way to give is through The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.

Polling data streaming into the broadcast and cable news networks indicated that nearly every state that had been in contention after eight months of hard campaigning was breaking for Senator John Kerry. President Bush, it seemed, would likely be a one-term president, just like his father. But shortly before the evening newscasts President Bush's campaign aides had words of warning for reporters and producers: Don't believe everything you see. And so began a battle of wills in which the president's advisers worked furiously behind the scenes, and sometimes on the air, to keep the networks from acting on the information from surveys of voters leaving the polls. Mr. Kerry's aides worked to bolster those numbers. And the networks strived to call the race as quickly as possible without making any mistakes. All sides had fresh memories of 2000, when flawed polling data and vote tabulations in Florida led the networks to call the race for Al Gore, then for Mr. Bush, then for neither. Mr. Bush's aides said the premature calls depressed his vote in Florida, while Mr. Gore said they sent him into the recount looking like a sore loser. From the start, the cable and broadcast networks made a big show of their newfound caution. And as the evening progressed, caution came to look increasingly prudent. As in 2000, there were again doubts about the reliability of the polling data. Then, differing interpretations emerged about the Ohio vote, again pushing the uncertainty of a winner into the early morning. In a move they might not have done in 2000, the networks held off from making early calls on states like South Carolina and Virginia, which they were certain Mr. Bush had in the bag. ''I enjoyed how much I've heard 'We don't know,''' Aaron Brown, the CNN anchor, told his colleague Wolf Blitzer on camera. Mr. Blitzer responded, ''We're not ashamed to say that.'' Tom Hannon, the CNN political director, told a visitor at his ''decision desk'' that the network was approaching the hard-fought swing states that polls had shown as too close to call ''as if we were a bomb disposal team. We're being very careful as we're taking them apart and trying to figure out what's happening.'' But the National Election Pool -- the new vote projection system run by the networks and The Associated Press and used by dozens of major news organizations, including The New York Times -- was indicating that the caution was perhaps unnecessary. Several waves of data about the national popular vote showed Mr. Kerry beating Mr. Bush by two to three percentage points. Early polling data from the states showed Mr. Kerry beating Mr. Bush in Pennsylvania and Ohio. And two out of three surveys of people leaving polls in Florida showed him winning there, too. (The third wave had the two candidates tied.) In short, Mr. Kerry seemed on the verge of winning the three states that most pundits believed could sway the election. Based on that data there was a pervasive sentiment within the corridors of Fox News Channel, beginning as early as late afternoon, that the race would be locked up long before midnight in Mr. Kerry's favor. While urging caution, John Moody, senior vice president at Fox News, said ''there are indications'' that the election will be over much earlier than in 2000. Over at NBC, Brian Williams, the NBC News correspondent and soon-to-be anchor of ''NBC Nightly News,'' said ''People were thinking they may have to make some reservations for Boston tomorrow morning.'' While the tone of the networks' on-air coverage did little to betray the inside knowledge, some clues, however subtle, seeped out early that the night might belong to Mr. Kerry. On ABC News, George Stephanopoulos, the host of ''This Week,'' said, ''Democrats are feeling good, feeling confident; the Republicans a little apprehensive.'' And in what may have been a Freudian slip, Martha MacCallum, one of the anchors on Fox News, referred to Senator Kerry as ''President Kerry,'' just after 8:30 p.m. Those kinds of comments and slips were not going unnoticed at Mr. Bush's campaign headquarters, where aides believed the polling data -- particularly from Florida -- to be skewed. ''It was really different from what we'd seen and it laid a foundation for the evening's coverage that was based on a flawed model,'' said Nicolle Devenish, Mr. Bush's campaign communications director. ''The coverage that ensued was 'Bush team worried; Kerry team giddy.' The coverage of that was based on a falsehood.'' Concerned that the tone -- along with polling data seeping out on the Internet -- would affect voter turnout on the West Coast, the Bush team continued their push. ''People on the West Coast are watching what happens on the East Coast,'' Ms. Devenish said. ''The whole kind of formula for an Election Day is a turnout mission and certainly when there's reporting based on inaccurate data it is not helpful.'' Mr. Bush's aides had some evidence to back up their claim. The national polls were showing far more women voting than men -- an anomaly that did not seem to add up. ''Either the data is wrong, or the demographics of the electorate has changed dramatically,'' said Mark McKinnon, a top strategist for Mr. Bush. An official with the National Election Pool, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it did appear that women -- who tend to prefer Democrats -- were overrepresented in the national poll. But, this official said, the same problem did not appear in the state polls, which were far more important and indicated Mr. Kerry was ahead. And producers at three major news organizations said they had come to the same conclusion. But after polls closed, and as more data trickled in, Mr. Bush's aides said they noticed new anomalies. All of the networks had hesitated to call Virginia and South Carolina for Mr. Bush to some part because polling data showed that Mr. Kerry was actually running ahead of him in Virginia by one point and was nipping at his heels in South Carolina, according to Matthew Dowd, Mr. Bush's chief campaign strategist. ''The exits said we would lose Virginia by one. We are probably going to carry it by eight,'' Mr. Dowd wrote in an e-mail message shortly before 10 p.m. ''Exits said we were going to lose South Carolina by six. We will win it by at least 10.'' Bush campaign officials gathered producers who were huddled at their Virginia headquarters and hit the phones and BlackBerries with a message: ''The early exit models undercounted Republicans.'' Similar conversations were taking place throughout the media landscape. ''I get all this stuff on my BlackBerry: buy this, don't buy that,'' Mr. Williams said, acknowledging, ''it may temper how you take in new information, though.'' Bill Wheatley, an NBC News vice president, called the early polling information ''junk,'' adding, ''The White House has been spinning us very hard, especially on Florida.'' And the Bush campaign seemed to have achieved at least some of what it wanted. ''The news from inside the Kerry camp, it's not discouraged yet, but not nearly as encouraging as earlier in the evening,'' Dan Rather, the CBS News anchor, told viewers. On the second floor of the CBS News Broadcast Center in Manhattan, John Roberts, the network's senior White House correspondent, was sifting through the mix of polling data and vote tabulations. ''Much of what you're seeing is based on very sophisticated exit polls,'' he said. ''But it's true that in the end, this election will be decided on some very old ways of voting.'' As Mr. Rather put it after 11 p.m., ''Put on a cup of coffee, this race is far from over.'' Within two hours -- first on Fox News, then on NBC and MSNBC -- the race seemed indeed over as these networks declared Mr. Bush the victor in Ohio. ''It's hard to see how George Bush is not going to be re-elected president of the United States,'' Tom Brokaw, the NBC anchor, said. But as the producers at CBS News saw their colleagues presenting Mr. Bush so close to victory, they decided not to follow. ''We're running our own show,'' Al Ortiz, CBS's director of special events, said in the control room. Marcy McGinnis, senior vice president for news coverage, said: ''Our decision desk believes it's just too close to call. There's a number of provisional ballots out there, and the information just isn't there yet.'' Now, it was Mr. Kerry's aides making the calls, warning that NBC and Fox News could live to regret the calls. ''Once again, they are being premature,'' said Joe Lockhart, a top aide to Mr. Kerry. Another Florida? he was asked. ''It sounds that way,'' he said. ''It's just a little farther north.''

Bush, and he can claim that an apparently insurmountable lead in the popular vote vindicated his policies, his persistence, his personal qualities and his political strategy. He bet that voters who had shared a traumatic terrorist attack and two wars on his watch would stand by him, and they appeared to. A president who won by a whisker four years ago, then governed as if he had a landslide, was within striking distance of an electoral vote mandate for a second term. He picked up Republican, and conservative, seats in a still-divided Senate, and support for his stance against gay marriage in states where ballot measures banning it won approval. In an election marked by divisiveness to the bitter end, much remained clouded early this morning: John Kerry's camp maintained that he could yet win pivotal Ohio and close the gap, and that uncertainties in Iowa and New Mexico might be resolved in his favor. But in sweet redemption, Mr. Bush exorcised the ghost of the Florida recount by winning a decisive victory in that state where his brother is governor and bid fair to become the only son of an American president ever to be elected president himself, then win a second term, and thus escape the curse of John and John Quincy Adams. ''I've given it my all,'' Mr. Bush said after voting yesterday morning, and millions of Republican voters returned the favor, outperforming the party's past margins in crucial counties and states from Florida to Ohio. Divided as the nation was and remains, Democrats apparently failed to realize their highest hopes that tens of millions of dollars and anger at Mr. Bush could galvanize enough voters to defeat him. So what next? If even a one-vote margin is a mandate, as John F. Kennedy once said, what might a real mandate look like for Mr. Bush? Will he pursue his course undaunted, whatever the opposition may do? Or once again seek, as he promised four years ago, to ''change the tone'' in Washington, and reach out to the one-quarter of voters in the electorate who described themselves as angry at his administration? The evidence is mixed, and second terms are notoriously unpredictable -- and disappointing. But Mr. Bush has never been a man to shrink from a fight, and he may well have a hot one on his hands soon enough, if there is a confirmation battle in the Senate to replace the ailing Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Perhaps no issue is more important than the judiciary to Mr. Bush's conservative base, including the 2 in 10 voters who yesterday told pollsters that ''moral issues'' mattered to them more than any other. And because victory would mean that the president would have a chance to nominate a clear conservative majority to the Supreme Court, no issue would be more contentious among Mr. Bush's liberal opponents, and Democrats seem all but certain to filibuster any choice they see as too extreme. Mr. Bush would become the 12th of the 17 incumbent presidents who have sought re-election since 1900 to win a second term. Already, through his aggressive handling of terrorism and foreign policy, he has made himself not only the most polarizing president since Richard M. Nixon but also guaranteed himself a prominent place in the history books ,and historical debate, for years to come. ''This is a latter-day Wilson presidency,'' said Richard Norton Smith, a scholar of the presidency and director of the Abraham Lincoln presidential library in Springfield, Ill., invoking Woodrow Wilson's impassioned intervention in World War I to make the world ''safe for democracy.'' ''It's going to matter, it's going to be pointed to -- pro and con -- for a long time.'' But any success for Mr. Bush was also very much Mr. Kerry's failure. If Mr. Bush struggled all year to post job approval ratings of 50 percent or better, a classic danger sign for an incumbent, Mr. Kerry failed all year to open a clear lead in the national polls. Mr. Kerry was counting on millions of first-time Democratic voters to carry him through, and millions apparently did turn out, but probably not enough to make the difference. Many of those who chose Mr. Kerry said they considered their vote to be against Mr. Bush, not for their candidate, according to surveys of voters leaving the polls. Only about half the voters yesterday had a favorable view of Mr. Kerry, about the same as for Mr. Bush, and he dueled Mr. Bush only to a draw on who would best handle the economy -- an issue that Mr. Kerry had once hoped to make his signature. Voters who cited honesty as the most important quality in a candidate broke 2 to 1 in Mr. Bush's favor, despite Mr. Kerry's relentless accusations that Mr. Bush had misled the public into war. Mr. Bush's chief political adviser, Karl Rove, had long believed that if he could draw out conservative and evangelical voters who stayed home four years ago, he could ''make the pie higher,'' as Mr. Bush once memorably said of his goals for economic growth. Differences in the wording of exit-poll questions between this year and 2000 made a definitive early assessment of how well that succeeded difficult, but a third of all voters yesterday identified themselves as evangelicals, according to surveys of voters leaving the polls. There were at least some signs that state ballot measures on gay marriage had helped boost conservative turnout. While domestic issues like health care seemed to resonate with voters more than questions of foreign policy, the war in Iraq was a drag on Mr. Bush's support, as it has been all year. While a bare majority of voters said the decision to go to war against Saddam Hussein was correct, a majority also said that it was going badly and had jeopardized the nation's long-term security. ''It's not Vietnam, but it stands in the shadow of Vietnam, and as a consequence, people see this as similar,'' said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian and biographer of Lyndon B. Johnson. ''There is no question Bush could have rallied the whole country to his side in the wake of Sept. 11, and kept it there. But he has been divisive and this is a knock on him.'' Mr. Bush's last presidential election may be over, but the first election in the post-Saddam Hussein Iraq has yet to be held. In his convention acceptance speech this summer, Mr. Bush himself acknowledged that when he campaigned four years ago, ''none of us could have envisioned what these years would bring.'' Once again, Mr. Bush and a divided nation may well have a chance to find out.

In two gains for the Democrats, Barack Obama, the state senator from Illinois who emerged as one of his party's brightest stars at last summer's Democratic convention, handily won his race for the United States Senate. He will become only the third black senator since Reconstruction. In Colorado, Ken Salazar, the Democratic state attorney general, beat Peter H. Coors, the beer magnate, to become the fourth Hispanic senator in history. There are no Hispanics in the Senate now; the last, Joseph Montoya, a New Mexico Democrat, left in 1977. But three races were too close to call. The Democrats' leader, Senator Tom Daschle, was locked in a fierce struggle in South Dakota, in a race fraught with political symbolism as his opponent, former Representative John Thune, served as a proxy for the White House. In Alaska, Senator Lisa Murkowski, who was appointed to her seat by her father, the current governor, was facing a stiff challenge from Tony Knowles, the former Democratic governor. Nepotism was the main issue in this contest. Alaska has not sent a Democrat to the Senate in more than two decades. And in Florida, Mel Martinez, a Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9 and Republican candidate, was locked in a dead heat against Betty Castor, a former state education official. Republicans, weary but clearly relieved, were declaring victory in the battle for both the Senate and the House. The Republicans maintained and perhaps slightly enlarged their majority in the House with the help of a disputed redistricting plan in Texas that sent several longtime Democratic incumbents to defeat. In the Senate, a string of Democratic retirements in the South created a critical opening for the Republicans. ''We've definitely retained the majority,'' Senator George Allen, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said early this morning as he awaited a few last results from Western states. Reflecting conservative strength in the Sun Belt states, Republican victories by Representative James W. DeMint in South Carolina and former Representative Tom Coburn in Oklahoma added two staunch conservatives to the Republican ranks. In Louisiana, another conservative, Representative David Vitter, barely avoided a runoff in a multicandidate race to replace the Democratic veteran, Senator John B. Breaux, who is retiring. And in North Carolina, Representative Richard M. Burr, a Republican, defeated Erskine Bowles, the former Clinton chief of staff, for the seat left vacant by Senator John Edwards, who ran for vice president. In Georgia, Johnny Isakson, a House member from the Atlanta suburbs, easily won the seat being vacated by Senator Zell Miller, the conservative Democrat who was retiring as an angry critic of his own party. Republicans also eked out a victory in Kentucky, where Senator Jim Bunning, a baseball hall of famer, had committed several verbal gaffes in the last few weeks and saw his once-comfortable lead over Dr. Daniel Mongiardo vanish. One thing Mr. Bunning said was that his opponent looked like one of Saddam Hussein's sons, a comment for which he later apologized. Most Senate incumbents easily won re-election. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York rolled up a lopsided victory, as expected, with strong majorities across the state over his main opponent, Assemblyman Howard D. Mills of Goshen. The marquee Senate race was in South Dakota, where Mr. Daschle, the Democratic leader, was struggling to hold onto the seat he has held for 18 years after a bruising campaign against Mr. Thune, a race expected to come down to just a few thousand votes. Elections officials were bracing for a long night of tallying absentee ballots by hand. At 56, Mr. Daschle has been the Democratic leader for 10 years, and a loss would be a huge psychological blow to his party. He raised more than $18 million for his campaign, flooding the state with television advertisements to remind voters of the millions in federal grant money he has taken home to South Dakota. But Mr. Thune hit back hard, characterizing Mr. Daschle as ''the chief obstructionist'' to President Bush's agenda, and out of touch with the values of ordinary South Dakotans. If Mr. Daschle loses, he will be the first Senate leader to do so since 1952, when Senator Ernest W. McFarland, the Arizona Democrat who was majority leader, lost to Barry Goldwater. At least two Democrats have been discussed as possible successors as minority leader: Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut. Democratic stalwarts in New England -- Mr. Dodd and Senator Patrick J. Leahy in Vermont -- easily retained their seats, as did Senator Evan Bayh, an Indiana Democrat. The Democratic senators Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland, Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota and Mr. Reid of Nevada also coasted to victory. So did Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer in California, Patty Murray in Washington and Ron Wyden in Oregon. Senator Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin held off a challenge from Tim Michels. Republican senators who also savored easy victories included Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, George V. Voinovich of Ohio, John McCain of Arizona, Christopher S. Bond of Missouri, Sam Brownback of Kansas, Michael Crapo of Idaho and Charles Grassley of Iowa. Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, staved off a challenge from Representative Joseph M. Hoeffel III. The two parties have fought intensely over control of the Senate for four years. Republicans held a tiny majority after 2000, but the Democrats won control when Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, a Republican, defected and became an independent in 2001. The Republicans returned to power in the 2002 midterm elections, a battle waged after the Sept. 11 attacks and in the months leading to the war in Iraq. Republicans headed into this campaign with what was effectively a 51-to-49 majority and high hopes of expanding it. Almost nobody expected them to gain the 60 votes necessary to cut off filibusters and really control the chamber, but enlarging their majority seemed likely. The map clearly worked to the Republicans' advantage. Democrats had to defend 19 seats, the Republicans only 15. And the Democratic Party found itself even more on the defensive across the South, after a string of Democratic retirements in states that tilt increasingly conservative -- including Louisiana, Georgia and the Carolinas. Republicans strengthened their grip on the region with a pickup in Georgia, where Mr. Isakson had long been expected to handily win the seat left vacant by the retirement Mr. Miller. The retirements in the South were a ''tremendous opportunity'' for the Republicans, said Merle Black, an expert on Southern politics at Emory University, making it all the harder for the Democrats to regain the majority. I This year could also be one for gains in the number of women in the Senate, which stands at 14, a record. Until 1992, no more than two women had served at once. Even with continued Republican control in the Senate, there will be major changes in the internal power structure. For the first time, Republican rules will go into effect that require Republican chairmen who have served for six years to step down from those posts. This means, for example, that Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the judiciary committee, must step aside, opening the way for Mr. Specter, who is next in line to become chairman. This comes at a time when the committee will almost certainly be considering nominees to the Supreme Court, making the ascension of a moderate like Mr. Specter a potential source of controversy within his conservative caucus.

But America's national election seemed to run smoothly yesterday, with no widespread reports of chaos, fraud or legal challenges that might affect the outcome. Caught in a huge turnout generated by a bitter campaign and polls showing a down-to-the-wire dead heat, voters across the country often stood for hours to cast ballots, determined to have a say in what many regarded as a turning point for a nation at the crossroads of war and a struggling economy. ''This year a lot of people will stand in line no matter how long,'' James Richmond said after a three-hour wait at a polling place in a Denver bookstore, where the line ran conveniently past a poetry section into the history aisle. ''America is pretty emotionally and politically charged,'' Mr. Richmond added. Beyond books and magazines, there were cellphones and quiet conversations to pass the time in a slow-moving line outside St. Anthony's Church in Greenwich Village, in New York City. Volunteers provided umbrellas for voters in lines on a rainy day in Cleveland. And Kerry supporters in Philadelphia cooked hamburgers on a sidewalk grill for those trapped in one polling place line. Still, patience ran thin and there were thousands of complaints across the country: of confusion and incompetence among election workers, of difficulty finding polling places, of polls opening late or shutting down early, of touch-screen machines that seemed to record votes incorrectly or not at all, of decades-old machines that jammed up, of partisan appeals being made inside the 100-foot no-electioneering zone. There was only one report of election-related violence. Two Bush supporters in Florida filed a lawsuit, seeking damages, claiming that they had been punched, pushed and spat upon by Democrats. In Madison, Wis., a man trying to vote found that his identity had already been used to cast a ballot. And there were other serious problems. Disputes over absentee ballots arose in at least two states. Pennsylvania Republicans filed suit in federal court in Philadelphia seeking to prevent absentee ballots from being counted before Friday, when names could be compared to registration rolls. And in Florida, many Palm Beach County residents who never received absentee ballots were having a hard time casting regular ballots. They were only required to sign oaths swearing they had not yet voted, but some poll workers were insisting on checking with a supervisor whose line was constantly busy. The Election Protection Coalition, a nonpartisan group that tracked problems in polling places, said it had received 23,000 reports of problems at the polls nationwide, including 1,100 about voting machines that malfunctioned and 8,900 incidents of voters not appearing on registration rolls. Thousands more involved problems with absentee ballots. Some disabled Florida voters who failed to receive absentee ballots were turned away when they tried to vote in person. Elsewhere in Florida, some Hispanic voters said they were falsely told the polls had closed early, and in New Mexico some voters said callers had given them phony information about changed polling places. In Nevada, election officials said calls had been made to some registered Democrats telling falsely of changes in the time and place of balloting. Others reported visits from strangers with ballots, which were to be filled out and handed back. More confusion surrounded the use of provisional ballots in many states. They were being used for the first time by voters whose names did not appear on official voter rolls. Some states counted them yesterday, others said they would do so only if a recount became necessary. Partisan poll watchers monitored balloting in Florida, Ohio, Iowa, Colorado and other swing states, many of them lawyers watching for chicanery. But fears that they would challenge and perhaps disenfranchise tens of thousands of voters in perilously close races, tipping the balance, were not borne out. Many were challenged, but survived examination of their qualifications and had voted by day's end. In Florida, 5,000 Republican poll watchers had been instructed to challenge anyone whose name did not appear on the rolls, who might have voted early or by absentee ballot and people convicted of felonies who had not received clemency. But such challenges appeared to be infrequent, and Allie Merzer, a spokeswoman for the Florida Democratic Party, said there had been no egregious cases. In closely contested Ohio, thousands of lawyers and other election monitors for the Republicans and the Democrats appeared at polling places across the state after being authorized by federal judges to challenge the eligibility of voters with questionable qualifications. The challengers appeared to be keeping an eye on each other, as well as the voters, and there were no reports that large numbers of voters were being challenged or denied a ballot. Republicans had contended that they wanted to exercise challenges to cut down on fraud, weeding out unregistered or ineligible voters, or anyone who tried to vote more than once. They said that they wanted only to guarantee a fair election for all. Democrats, who said they did not intend to challenge any voters, charged that the Republican challengers were really out to intimidate voters, especially low-income and minority voters, who might be singled out disproportionately. Making this argument in court, Democrats had won orders from federal judges in Cincinnati and Akron barring challengers from polling places. The judges held that fraud-prevention measures were already in place and that aggressive challenges might cause chaos and intimidate some voters. But the Republicans appealed, and an appellate court in Cincinnati overturned the rulings early yesterday. Justice John Paul Stevens of the Supreme Court agreed, clearing the way for the challengers. In Iowa, election officials and voters were congratulating themselves by late afternoon for having a smooth Election Day, despite what was expected to be a record turnout of 1.4 million voters. Thousands of lawyers had volunteered to help if trouble arose, but most were ''sitting around twiddling their thumbs,'' said Jean Hessburg, executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party. There were no reports of major problems at polling places in Minnesota, although there were scattered complaints of malfunctioning voting machines and electioneering too close to the polls. There were similar complaints in New Mexico, but no major disruptions were reported at the state's 1,400 polling places The voting in New York City's 6,090 election districts went slowly but smoothly for the most part. There were long lines at nearly all the polling places, and it often took more than an hour to cast a ballot. Some polling places opened late. There were scattered voting-machine breakdowns, and in some cases election workers seemed more confused than the voters. At a polling place at 45 Wall Street in Lower Manhattan, things got off to a shaky start. Voters began lining up at 6 a.m., but the poll did not open until 7 a.m., an hour late, according to Jim Jordan, 34, who works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. By then, the lines snaked down Wall Street to the to the statue of George Washington outside Federal Hall. Five election workers finally appeared, but seemed not to know what to do, said Louise Burley, an inspector for the Board of Elections. She gave them a quick tutorial. Then, as things got started, one of the two voting machines -- devices that dated from the early 1960's -- broke down. Frustrations mounted. ''People were a little upset,'' Ms. Burley said. For two hours, until technicians fixed the broken machine, the election workers resorted to another, older technology: paper ballots stuffed through a slit in a cardboard box marked: ''Official Ballot Box.'' Sharon Felder, 46, who lives in the neighborhood, waited only a half-hour in line. ''This is the most important election of my lifetime,'' Ms. Felder said. ''It's worth the wait.'' By early afternoon, the New York Public Interest Research Group reported 1,500 calls from voters seeking information on polling locations or complaining about long lines, late openings, ill-trained election officials and voting machine malfunctions. The Board of Elections had 75 technicians to repair machines in all five boroughs. In Newark, 200 people were turned away by election officials at one polling place in the morning, mostly because their names were not on voter registration lists. The 200 went to an Election Day law clinic where five Superior Court judges heard their cases and issued orders that permitted nearly all of them to cast their ballots. There were also false alarms. In Philadelphia, Republican poll monitors looking for any sign of irregularities complained that voting machines already had thousands of votes on them when the polls opened at 7 a.m. Election officials and prosecutors rushed to investigate, but discovered that the Republican operatives had mistakenly read numbers from a counter that records every vote ever cast on a machine -- not the one that was to record yesterday's tally. And in Mount Laurel, N.J., a polling place at the Fleetwood School was closed by the police for two hours after election officials found a white powder on the floor. The unsolved anthrax attacks of 2001, which killed five people and injured 17 others, leaped to mind. But the suspicious substance turned out to be common table salt, the police said, and voting resumed at 11 a.m. How Election Day Polls Were Conducted The Election Day polls were based on questionnaires completed by voters as they left voting stations throughout the country. The polls were conducted by Edison Media Research of Somerville, N.J., and Mitofsky International of New York City for the National Election Pool, a consortium of ABC News, The Associated Press, CBS News, CNN, Fox News and NBC News. The national results are based on 13,047 voters in 250 precincts across the United States. These include 500 absentee voters and early voters interviewed by telephone. The state results are based on 872 to 2,846 voters in 28 to 51 randomly selected precincts across each of 18 states analyzed by The Times. In certain states some interviews were also conducted by telephone with absentee voters and early voters. In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls should differ by no more than plus or minus one to two percentage points nationally, and three to five points in each state, from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all voters who cast ballots in each of these elections. Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election Day, like the reluctance of some voters to take time to fill out the questionnaire, may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

VOTING Confusion in New York  With a huge turnout testing New York City's antiquated voting system, voters complained of long lines, confusion and broken machines at some polling places.

But in what was shaping up as a Midwest replay of 2000, Mr. Kerry's campaign challenged the results in Ohio and said it would not abandon the campaign until all the votes in that critical state were counted. Mr. Bush's aides said early this morning that they were convinced that he had won Ohio which, combined with his victory in Florida, would guarantee him a second term. But at 2:30 this morning, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, Mr. Kerry's running mate, made a brief and dramatic appearance in front of a huge crowd of supporters at Copley Square in Boston to announce that he and Mr. Kerry would not concede. ''It's been a long time -- but we've waited four years for this victory,'' he said to thousands of people who earlier had been expecting Mr. Kerry to be delivering a victory speech on that very spot. ''We can wait one more night.'' In what sounded like a hint of concerted legal action ahead, Mr. Edwards added tersely: ''John Kerry and I made a promise to the American people that in this election, every vote would count and every vote would be counted. Tonight, we are keeping our word.'' As of 2 a.m. this morning, Mr. Bush had 2,685,059 votes, compared with 2,564,047 for Mr. Kerry, or an edge of 121,012 votes. Mr. Kerry's aides said that they believed the vote could be turned around once provisional ballots -- those submitted by people who were unable to vote because their names not on registration rolls -- had been tallied. ''The vote count in Ohio has not been completed,'' said Mary Beth Cahill, Mr. Kerry's campaign manager. ''There are more than 250,000 remaining votes to be counted. We believe when they are, John Kerry will win Ohio.'' The dispute provided a chaotic conclusion to a long gyrating night of counting that vividly recalled the turmoil of four years ago. In addition to the problem in Ohio, Iowa officials said that they would do a recount in that state, where Mr. Bush had a lead of 11,000 with 94 percent of the vote counted. An evening of confusion -- and deflation for Mr. Kerry's aides and Democrats across the country -- caused in no small part by surveys of voters leaving the polls, which showed Mr. Kerry leading Mr. Bush by as much as 3 percentage points nationally. With 86 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Bush was leading Mr. Kerry 51 percent to 48 percent. Americans turned out in big numbers to vote, according to officials from both parties, lining up at polling places across the country -- from Ohio to Florida, from New York to Minnesota -- in an evocative conclusion to one of the most emotionally charged campaigns in a century. Polls taken up to the eve of the election showed Mr. Bush tied with Mr. Kerry, and party officials suggested that the turnout in this hard-fought election could match the modern-day record of 63 percent set in 1960. In Ohio, lines were so long that some polling places stayed open past the 7:30 p.m. closing time. One in seven people who voted yesterday did not participate in the 2000 election, and 60 percent of those voters said they supported Mr. Kerry, according to surveys of voters leaving the polls. And throughout the day, Republicans appeared concerned by the images of long lines of Americans waiting to vote, particularly in cities and in areas with large numbers of minority voters. A survey of voters leaving the polls suggested that the turnout was at least partly inspired by anger among Democrats lingering from Mr. Bush's disputed victory in 2000. But White House officials said they remained confident that the Republicans' own turnout effort -- aimed at evangelical Christians who Mr. Bush's advisers believed had failed to vote in 2000 -- would counter the opposition to Mr. Bush, and prevent him from facing the fate of his father, who lost re-election to Bill Clinton in 1992. Mr. Bush won Florida, seizing one of the big three states that have become the focus of both parties for much of the year and the state that was at the emotional fulcrum of the battle of 2000. Mr. Kerry won the second of those three states, Pennsylvania, and the two men were engaged in what could well prove to be a climactic fight in Ohio. For all the concern before the voting about irregularities at the polls, there were few reports of problems as night fell across the country, even in states where Mr. Kerry and Mr. Bush had dispatched squads of lawyers, all briefed up but with no courts to go to. Late last night -- even before the polls had closed in Nevada and Iowa, two particularly competitive states -- Mr. Bush summoned reporters and photographers to White House residence where he was watching election results with his family, including his father, the former president. ''We're very upbeat, thank you,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I believe I will win.'' A little while later, a senior Kerry adviser, Joe Lockhart, appeared before reporters to say much the same thing. ''The first state that we believe will flip is New Hampshire,'' Mr. Lockhart said, referring to a state that Mr. Bush won in 2000 and that Democrats are confident of winning this time. But as the night churned on, facing excruciatingly close tallies in Ohio, Wisconsin, New Mexico and Iowa, aides to Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry were contemplating another inconclusive election night, though none suggested they were facing a repeat of the 36-day count of 2000. ''We're counting all the votes,'' said Mike McCurry, Mr. Kerry's chief spokesman. ''At the end of the day, we win. I'm not sure what day, but we win.'' Ralph Nader, the independent candidate who many Democrats believe effectively handed the White House to Mr. Bush in 2000 by drawing votes from Al Gore, was winning a minimal number of votes and did not appear to be a factor in the outcome of the race. It was an appropriately chaotic end -- or near-end -- of the 2004 campaign in many ways began the night in December 2000 when the United States Supreme Court effectively declared Mr. Bush the nation's 43rd president. It took place during one of the most difficult periods of the nation's history, framed by the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon that took place less than one year into Mr. Bush's term. The attacks shaped not only Mr. Bush's first term as president, but also his re-election campaign against Mr. Kerry. In a sign of the intensity of the contest, both Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry took the unusual step of campaigning right through Election Day. Mr. Kerry began his day visiting a campaign office in LaCrosse, Wis., while Mr. Bush brought Air Force One into Columbus, Ohio, for one last visit to a state he won in 2000, but where he was struggling for victory again. No Republican has won the presidency without winning Ohio. Mr. Bush flew to Ohio from Texas, and he dropped in on the state's Bush-Cheney headquarters in Columbus to thank campaign workers. At one point Mr. Bush took the phone from a volunteer, Mick Turner, who was making calls urging voters to get to the polls, and said: ''Julie. This is President Bush calling. How are you? No, I promise you it's me.'' Mr. Bush then put one finger in his other ear to hear her better and said: ''I'm proud to have your support. I appreciate you taking my phone call. Thank you so very much.'' Mr. Bush then hung up and said to reporters, ''1 to 0.'' Mr. Bush voted in Crawford, Tex., at 8 a.m. with his wife and twin daughters. The president's eyes were puffy from a 19-hour, seven-stop, six-state campaign swing the day before, and he appeared calm if wistful as he talked to reporters. ''This election is in the hands of the people, and I feel very comfortable about that,'' he said. ''The people know where I stand. I've enjoyed this campaign. It's been a fantastic experience traveling our country, talking about what I believe and where I'm going to lead this country for four more years.'' Asked if he had any words for Mr. Kerry, the president responded: ''I wish him all the best. You know, he and I are in the exact same position. We've given it our all and I'm -- I'm sure he is happy, like I am, that the campaign has come to a conclusion.'' In Wisconsin, which Al Gore won in 2000, Mr. Kerry went to an office to pump up supporters before heading home to Boston, where he cast his ballot with his daughters before lunching, as he has every Election Day he has run for office since his first victory in 1982, at the Union Oyster House. ''This campaign has been an amazing journey, a wonderful journey,'' he told reporters after emerging from the polling place at the historic Statehouse downtown. ''The American people have put their homes, their hearts to us.'' Mr. Kerry, at once nostalgic and exuberant, said that he was ''very confident that we made the case for change,'' but that ''what's really important is that the president and I both love this country.'' ''Whatever the outcome tonight,'' he added, ''I know one thing that is already an outcome -- our country will be stronger, our country will be united, and we will move forward, no matter what, because that's who we are as Americans. And that's what we need to do.'' This campaign came to a conclusion -- even an uncertain one -- shaped by the three forces that had formed it from the beginning: the attacks of Sept. 11, the disputed election of 2000 and the war in Iraq. From the start of this contest, Mr. Kerry presented himself as the Democrat best able to take on Mr. Bush because of his record as a Vietnam veteran which, he said, would allow him to hold his own with the president on security issues, and turn the campaign to what he argued would be strong ground for Democrats: domestic issues. With the economy struggling and the war in Iraq going off course, Mr. Bush increasingly built his campaign around the threat of terrorism, invoking the symbols of the attack on the World Trade Center and portraying Mr. Kerry as not having the strength to stand up to terrorist attacks. The survey of voters leaving the polls found that Mr. Bush did indeed enjoy a big advantage over Mr. Kerry on the issue of terrorism. But it also showed that a majority now believed that the war had gone badly off course, and had jeopardized the long-term security of the United States. And while Mr. Bush was seen as much better able to protect the nation from terrorist attacks than Mr. Kerry was, the survey suggested that in the end, domestic issues -- like health care and job creation -- were critical factors in the choices of many Americans, and many of those voters were going to Mr. Kerry. Both parties had identified get-out-the-vote efforts as critical to victory in an election where poll after poll showed Mr. Kerry and Mr. Bush evenly matched. For Democrats, it was a matter of building on the anger still burning from 2000. For Mr. Bush's chief strategist, Karl Rove, it was a matter of motivating what he said was four million evangelicals who had not been there for Mr. Bush in 2000, and who would respond to a campaign appeal that was built to a large extent by trying to paint cultural differences with Mr. Kerry on such issues as gay marriage and abortion rights. Mr. Rove appears to have had at least some success on that count. The surveys found that voters cited three issues as central in making their decision: the economy, terrorism and moral issues, and Mr. Bush won among voters who cited moral issues.
