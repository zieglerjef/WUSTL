{"title": "Oracle Raises Its Hostile Bid For PeopleSoft By $3, to $24", "body_text": "Oracle raised its offer for PeopleSoft on Monday from $21 a share to $24 a share. The higher bid, which values PeopleSoft at $9.2 billion, comes less than a month after Oracle executives said in Delaware Chancery Court that the company was leaning toward lowering its offer. The latest offer, Oracle's fifth since it first announced its hostile takeover bid for PeopleSoft in June 2003, comes just a week after the European Commission said it would not block the merger, removing the last regulatory hurdle to the deal. Both companies make software that large corporations use to manage their operations and handle tasks like accounting and human resources management. Jeff Henley, Oracle's chairman, called the new price per share to be Oracle's ''best and final offer,'' and urged PeopleSoft shareholders to act quickly. The company said that it would withdraw the offer if a majority of PeopleSoft shares were not tendered by Nov. 19. ''We think the time has come for the stockholders of PeopleSoft to decide the outcome,'' Mr. Henley said during a conference call with analysts early Monday. It was unclear on Monday how Oracle arrived at the latest price. But its executives told analysts that the company decided to raise its offer after the judge in the Delaware case, Vice Chancellor Leo E. Strine Jr., asked Oracle to put out its best offer before he made a ruling in the case. Oracle had sued PeopleSoft in Delaware to force it to remove its poison pill provision, which would make a hostile acquisition prohibitively expensive. The provision would release a flood of additional shares to the market and make it nearly impossible for an acquirer to gain a controlling stake in the company. Mr. Henley said the $24-a-share offer was 60 percent higher than PeopleSoft's closing price the day before Oracle's initial offer in June 2003, and is ''substantially higher than what PeopleSoft would be trading at if it weren't for the Oracle offer.'' Oracle executives also said that even at $24 a share, the merger would add to Oracle's earnings per share within 12 months, excluding some expenses. The news caused PeopleSoft shares to gain $2.16, to close at $22.93. In response to the higher bid, PeopleSoft's board advised shareholders to ''take no action at this time,'' and said it would meet to review the offer and make a recommendation, but gave no indication of the timing. The board's statement noted that in February it rejected Oracle's offer of $26 a share, the highest bid offered. Oracle reduced that to $21 a share in May after a decline in the share price. PeopleSoft, based in Pleasanton, Calif., has continually contended that the hostile merger is bad for its customers. But in Monday's announcement, Oracle appeared to be trying to appease PeopleSoft customers by stating that it planned to release an upgrade to PeopleSoft's software, though there was no indication that Oracle would sustain two product lines for the long term. Previously, Oracle, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., said it would provide support for PeopleSoft products for a decade but would not expand or further develop PeopleSoft's product line. At the trial last month, Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle's chief executive, and Safra A. Catz, Oracle's co-president, both told the Delaware court that the company was leaning toward lowering its offer rather than raising it because PeopleSoft's business was suffering. But many analysts viewed the courtroom statements by Oracle executives as an effort to pressure PeopleSoft shareholders. David Hilal, an analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey, called the courtroom comments by the Oracle leaders ''posturing.'' Mr. Hilal said he believed all along that Oracle would be willing to pay more than $21 a share for PeopleSoft because it wanted the merger. Now at $24 a share, he said, there is no reason for PeopleSoft shareholders not to tender their shares. ''If you were a PeopleSoft shareholder, why wouldn't you tender?'' Mr. Hilal said, since the new price offers a premium over the company's value. Others disagreed. Tad Piper, an analyst with Piper Jaffray & Company, said he did not think that the PeopleSoft board was ready to accept the latest offer, nor was Oracle's latest offer necessarily its last. ''I don't think we've read the final chapter in this soap opera,'' Mr. Piper said. ''I'm not convinced the board is going to come out in support of this offer, after they rejected $26.'' Even though PeopleSoft has not performed well this year, he said, it still has a business that could add to Oracle's earnings per share. PeopleSoft countered on Monday that discussions between the companies and the judge were confidential, and that it was inappropriate for Oracle to comment publicly on them. PeopleSoft called Oracle's comments Monday inaccurate but would not elaborate. ''In light of Oracle having chosen to characterize this off-the-record conference, we feel compelled to simply note that we believe that Oracle's comment does not accurately reflect what occurred,'' PeopleSoft said Monday. Oracle executives said they would ask Vice Chancellor Strine to take action if a majority of PeopleSoft shareholders tendered shares by Nov. 19 and PeopleSoft did not rescind its poison pill. The company has also asked the judge to force PeopleSoft to cancel its customer assurance plan, which could create a $2 billion liability for Oracle after a merger. During the Delaware trial, PeopleSoft directors told the court that they would consider an Oracle offer for PeopleSoft if the price was raised and certain conditions were met. On Oct. 5, the second day of the trial, Steven D. Goldby, a PeopleSoft director, testified that a deal would be possible under certain conditions. TECHNOLOGY"}
