{"title": "Sports Dollars Lavished On the Political Parties", "body_text": "When Don King prowled the Republican National Convention in New York in August, he called President Bush the ''man with the plan.'' He told USA Today that the president ''has the flexibility'' -- like Sugar Ray Robinson -- ''you know what I mean, to be able to do whatever is necessary at the moment that it is necessary, to rise to the occasion, you know what I mean?'' Beyond praising Bush, has King done his financial part for the re-election of Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney? In June 2003, King, a fight promoter, gave $2,000 to Bush and donated $42,500 to the Republican National Committee and $5,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee. But he also threw $2,000 into the failed Democratic presidential primary campaigns of Richard A. Gephardt and Carol Moseley Braun. He did not donate a dollar to the campaign of Senator John F. Kerry, the Democratic nominee. Meanwhile, Bob Arum, the best-known boxing promoter this side of King, did not provide a pro-Kerry counterbalance; he also gave $2,000 to Bush. Don King Productions, King's promotional firm, ranked in the top five among sports-related companies in political donations to candidates for federal office during the 2003-4 election cycle, according to opensecrets.org, a Web site created by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Leading the list was Major League Baseball, with $300,116 distributed by its political action committee to various candidates, party committees and PAC's. It was followed by International Speedway ($112,096) and the National Basketball Association ($111,300). The largest individual beneficiaries of Major League Baseball's largess in Congress, at $10,000 each, were three Republicans: Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which has oversight over baseball's antitrust exemption; Sen. Jim Bunning of Kentucky, who threw a perfect game against the Mets 40 years ago; and House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois. Commissioner Bud Selig contributed $250 to Sensenbrenner, according to opensecrets.org and the Federal Election Commission. Paul Tagliabue, the N.F.L. commissioner, gave $2,000 to the Bush-Cheney campaign and $1,000 to Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut in his failed effort to win the Democratic presidential nomination. David Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, was a lavish pro-Democratic contributor, giving $2,000 to the Kerry-John Edwards campaign, $25,000 to the Kerry Victory 2004 committee and $32,500 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, gave $2,000 to the president, but also $2,000 to Senator Bob Graham of Florida, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination. Steinbrenner's son, Hal, gave $5,000 to the Republican National Committee. Steinbrenner's nemeses with the Boston Red Sox -- the principal owner John W. Henry and the part owner Tom Werner -- contributed $2,000 apiece to Kerry, a Massachusetts senator. They, along with General Manager Theo Epstein, campaigned with Kerry on Sunday in Manchester, N.H. Charles Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision, which owns the Knicks and Rangers, gave $2,000 to Bush and Kerry, as did his son, James, the Cablevision president, who oversees the teams and Madison Square Garden. Charles Dolan gave $25,000 to the Republican National Committee, and his son gave $5,000 to the Democratic National Committee. Fred Wilpon, the Mets' principal owner, gave Bush $2,000, but his son, Jeff, the team's chief operating officer, gave $2,000 to Bush and Kerry. (The former co-owner of the Mets, Nelson Doubleday, gave the Republican National Committee $2,000.) Jeff Vanderbeek, the investment banker turned owner of the Devils, gave $8,000 to two Bush-Cheney committees, while the former owner, John J. McMullen, gave $25,000 to Kerry Victory 2004. Bruce C. Ratner, the Nets' owner, had no contributions listed, but Charles Kushner, who bid against him for the team (and recently pleaded guilty to attempting to compromise a witness in a campaign-finance investigation), gave $52,500 to the Democratic party, and $2,000 to Lieberman. Woody Johnson, the Jets' owner and a longtime Bush backer, gave $25,000 to the Republican National Committee. Wellington Mara of the Giants gave $2,000 to Bush, and Bob Tisch, the co-owner, gave $2,000 to Kerry and Bush. In sports television, the Bush-Cheney campaign received $2,000 apiece from Sean McManus, the president of CBS Sports; George Bodenheimer, the president of ESPN and ABC Sports; and Steve Bornstein, the president of the NFL Network. Among sportscasters, Jim Nantz, Al Michaels and Pat Summerall each gave $2,000 to Bush, and Troy Aikman gave Bush $8,000. Bill Walton and John McEnroe gave Kerry $2,000, and Jon Miller donated $1,000. Jim Lampley gave $1,000 to Edwards's presidential primary effort. SPORTS BUSINESS Correction:  November 4, 2004, Thursday  The Sports Business column on Tuesday, about political contributions from sports-related managements, referred incorrectly to those of the National Basketball Association. The $111,300 in contributions linked to the N.B.A. were made by individuals employed by the league, most notably by Commissioner David Stern, not by the league itself."}
